Revolutions are in fashion these days. create your facebook groups, expose their misspending and start your own revolutions.

Tired of supporting these bums they are a burden on Canada and we give them a huge amount tax money transfer payments for what again,,they do not call themselves Canadians they hate us, get rid of Quebec

However, I cannot understand how corporate mergers and takeovers improve competition. It seems big corporations will continue to absorb each other until there remains only a handful of multinationals controlling everything, pretty much outside the purview of governments. Is this "globalization"?

Clement said that there was a process that they would be putting the review through, but Comartin countered by stating that Clement himself claimed that the Investment Canada Act was fundamentally broken, for which Clement had no response.   This isn`t just the sale of a corporation, this is the wholesale sell-off of our major stock exchange, which will then fall under the majority jurisdiction of the LSX.   How anyone can think that this sale will benefit AVERAGE Canadians must have their head buried in the sand.

The provincial finance minister has made it quite clear he is not happy with this merger. It seems some Bay St. minions are squaking against the deal. It first I thought it would happen. Now I doubt it will happen. I'm thinking it should not happen. The reason is because LSE will actually be the owner of the TSX.  I can see the upside for traders. Somewhere in the future stuff is going to happen and Canada may be hurt.

Both Toronto and London, with similar market caps (TSX approx. Cdn$3billion; LSE approx Cdn$3.9billion) face increasing competition from alternative trading systems. SGX, the Singapore exchange, is moving forward with plans to buy its Australian counterpart ASX, another exchange heavily weighted with natural resource stocks, in a deal valued at $8.3 billion.  In fact, we are beginning to see a frenzy of exchange merger talks around the world.  There will be a great deal of discussion about foreign control of natural resources as these mergers progress; however, the one issue that I haven't seen raised is one which seems important to me;  that is, to what extent will social unrest in one country affect the stocks of the other country in a merger.    Many investors choose Canada as a safe, socially-secure country in which to invest money.  No exchange would want to have partnered with the Egyptian Stock Exchange which lost 17% of its value on January 30 and has been closed for three weeks as a result of pro-democracy protests.    My concern is:  if London should suffer a period of social unrest, would it affect the merged Canadian stock exchange?  Of course, it could be Canada suffering social unrest, but, as I have already said, many, many investors choose Canada for the simple reason that it has a long history of favorable conditions for business.   I trust this issue will be raised in the merger discussions that take place in Ottawa.

Sounds like a buy out to me.  If they were to just list each others stocks and trade in them then that's ok, but if down the road in 2-3 years the TSE just gets merged into the LSE and disappears completely off the radar (like the Vancouver & Calgary exchanges ended up after 'merging' with the TSE) then it's a no deal!

The stock exchange is a private business. The stock market is regulated, which means that stock exchanges that want to operate have to abide by the rules of the market which are set by government. Buying and selling the stock exchange has no effect on stock market regulation, either here or in the UK.   If a UK company bought a Maple Leaf Foods, Maple Leaf Foods would still have to abide by Canadian health regulations....

IN fact, I don't think it's in keeping with democracy to have this anything but tabled in the commons and decisions made there. This is a minority government after all and there are laws against selling any more than 10% of a principal Canadian asset to any foreign ownership.  So, how the LSE thinks it's going to gobble up more than 1/2 our resource exchange is beyond me. In essence, and under the current law, it is not allowable.  But then, I think that's why Harper wants' Clement to do this. It would appear he (Harper) thinks that we are collectively too stupid to figure out the actual law about this which exists and of course asking the British if it's a good idea is kind of silly to begin with.  I don't have a problem with internal conglomeration of stock markets that allow Canadian stock to be traded for as long as the day is long here coast to coast, but when we start talking about letting other foreigners have anything more than a say about the stock they've purchase and only within that 10% ruling, then we are going to have a problem.  I think it would be stupid for us to do this. The LSE is a house of rats that just recently failed. HELLO! We can't possibly be so stupid as to even entertain this obvious takeover.   Harper hasn't got a democratic bone in his body. Let's get rid of him before we get rid of our principal assets.

Thomas Mulcair's fear-mongering on that basis should be a great stain on his reputation.  The LSE and TSX are stock exchanges, which are private businesses which provide a venue (once trading floors, now computer systems) that allow brokers to buy and sell stock in different companies. Neither exchange owns the companies that are listed on the exchanges. Neither exchange is owned, nor ever was owned, by either the British or the Canadian governments. There is more than one stock exchange in Canada, and any one is free to set one up, as long as they can fit within the regulatory framework laid down by governments. Owning a stock exchange does not let one control the stock market, the companies listed on the exchange or any resources, trademarks, patents, labour, raw materials, or product of any companies listed on the exchange.  It's like saying a fish market owns the oceans....  As a merged company, the LSE/TSX will have to abide by British securities regulations in London, and by Canadian securities regulations in Toronto.  Just as any multi-national business has to abide by the local laws of each jurisdiction they operate in.   Potash Corp. impacted use of Canadian resources because of the deals that company has with the government of Saskatchewan. But potash is mostly an American company. So it wasn't being kept "Canadian", it was simply being kept as it was. The exchange merger has nothing in common with the Potash case.

To me strategic assets are critical resources and the largest companies involved in producing them. Fertilizer, basic materials, fuel etc. Things that we would need to maintain society or prepare for war if, for some reason, international trade was blocked. This company doesn't produce anything or control the means of producing anything we consume.  A stock exchange just moves money around from people with excess savings to companies that are raising money to expand their operations. If London screwed up our exchange somehow it isn't like that would actually prevent Canadians from investing in Canadian companies. In fact I just checked and there are at least 5 stock exchanges in Canada already. There's no reason why companies currently on the TSX couldn't abandon it and list themselves on another exchange if they needed to.

If it futher expands the capability of rich corporate conglomerates to exploit the weakest and most vulnerable then that's all that needs to learned. Don't expect for one second that this current group of corporate raiders is out for the best interest of Canada or Canadians, the only test that needs to be met is if it will increase corporate profits. Tax cuts for the rich while leaving the working class to pick up the tab are just more proof of that. We are still in the dark as to how the current corporate tax cuts will be paid for.

The federal government supported one exchange for the country but now it would be far reaching afield.  For those provinces who still have your own exchange, do not amalgamate with the TSX because it will soon be run by Europe. This will not be positive for investment in your provinces.

I.e., there is no GST on brokerage fees, only the possibility of capital gains tax on stocks being sold.  In the UK there is a stamp duty on trades, closing trades send 0.5% to the government.  Seems to me it's the UK that should be worried with the possibility of their tradings tax cow finding its way over here with us being the tax haven. Hard to believe, I know, but then it was the Conservatives in power when the GST was invented.

There is NOTHING free market about having the only real stock exchange of two countries merge and put all their eggs in one cosmic basket. It has nothing to do with competition, natural prices etc... If anything there should be more stock markets, more options for trading, for minority share interests, etc... as opposed to making it easier for moneyed people to hoard their cash and make even more money through speculation rather than entrepreneurship. Or do I misunderstand the conservative agenda?

If this deal goes through, it doesn't mean that wealthy London bankers will own all our resources and commodities.  People need to realize that these stock exchanges are privately owned enterprises. They are seeking to expand their market share and seek more investors, in doing so they will increase firms exposure to investors across the world. On the other side, these exchanges provide a vital service for the countries that they are in by allowing local firms to raise capital.  There are questions that need to be answered though. If the LSE has the majority stake in the new company, will that mean that small firms in Richmond and Laval will have to petition the exchange in London in order to be granted a listing? Is there not the hazard that a British owned exchange could punish Canadian firms by not allowing them access to the market so that British firms face less competition?  How will the regulatory environment be structured? There isn't a Canadian regulator at the moment, the various provinces have their own. If this goes through, will Canadian firms have to comply with different regulations?  The article mentions that the company will have 2 headquarters, but what will they be responsible for? Will they be responsible for local firms? Or will they be divided in terms of sector (ie Resource in TO, Financial in London). What will be the hours of business? WIll we be able to trade for 5 extra hours a day?  Would be nice if CBC posted a more detailed article that answered issues like those I have mentioned.

Add nothing - not even humour.   Zen Budhhist quotation " The finger pointing at the moon is not the moon"  The underlying commodities do not change. The exchange's function does not change. The ownership of the company that operates the exchange changes - is all.  The question is whether a 12%(approx as I recall) ownership stake by a Middle Eastern "sovereign wealth" fund & the other owners of the LSE having a combined total of 55% ownership can be an undue risk.   The benefits? Fairly obvious to anyone investing in large caps, financials & other global companies listed on the LSE. I would like a chance to trade those that pay a much richer dividend than found with North American Stocks. At the minute, it can't be done by this retail ivestor expect with a delay & a fair amount of expense. I would hope to open a sterling account for such trading just as I can a US$ account right now. The folks in the UK would love a crack at our resource sector. It would be like playing a video game for them.  OK. Shoot me up all you absurdly partisan leftiies & Liberals.

First we have this merger, a move to tie in Canadian financial markets to those in the UK.  The UK has no resources and twice our population.  They need to ensure their ongoing access to our resources as well as the opportunity to prosper off the wholesale of said resources to our trading partners.  Secondly we have the US and Canada "Security Perimeter" scheme.  One where the Department of Homeland Security needs to shore up secure, unfettered access to things like; Oil, Natural Gas, Hydro, fresh water and other raw materials.  Another country, this time with ten times our population and not nearly enough resources to sustain them.  Between the Brits having a say in how we run our markets and the US rewriting many of our regulations for their benefit, our sovereignty is about to disappear entirely.  We will effectively become a banana republic jointly run by Britain and the US.
