Why would an MLA need a generator in the legislature? Well, he actually wanted one for his cabin or travel trailer but what the heck, why pay for it yourself when you have an expense account. And he is only making six figures per year so he deserves some perks!

It will then be up to the voters of NS to get rid of them in the next election. And remember though, that who ever you may vote in to replace your thief, chances are the new wannabe is just as capable of ripping you off as well. The system the MLAs put in place for their far too easy to get pensions and entitlements is still in place. Imagine these MLAs and their leaders telling us that they have to pay these big wages and pensions and entitlements in order to attract "quality" people into politics. Well that theory went out the window when the AG finally showed how right we were to suspect wrong doings going on in our government.And if what we had and still have is "quality" people, then we have been lied to again by the various leaders of the Parties. Enough BS. This is why more and more people have stopped voting. ABC ABL ABNDP

It's about time - I was beginning to think they had buried the "MLA Expense Scandal".  However, II still think that the others who supposedly submitted expense claims that later had to be paid back, should also be charged.  If it were you or I, we sure would be!

I know he'll cling to his seat in the legislature, but just like a government falls when it's lost the confidence of the legislature, Zinck has lost the confidence of the voters.  Furthermore, given the level of trust we place in our MLAs, they should be held to a higher standard, and therefore, should face stricter sentencing when they breech the public trust.  There should be no conditional sentences and house arrest for these turkeys.  They have committed crimes against ALL Nova Scotians, and should face punishments that reflect that.

Do they really think that we believe that they are more honest than average? If jack would make this part of the nd's platform, he could tap the voters that are disgusted by the financial antics of some politicians.

We have seen numerous MLAs in court, we saw the Libs stealing money from the NSLC, and we saw the Tories sneak millions of dollars into the hands of their business buddies.  Now we give the NDP a chance, and they are the first bunch who are being responsible, transparent and reeling in the spending that the previous governments felt so entitled to!  FINALLY a government who are making things better in this province and who are making things right!

Dexter illegally used funds for computers and cameras for his kidsand when caught paid for them. It is still thief. If he had never been caught he would have continued on as normal.

The AG operates independantly.  Dexter was happy to have his law society fees paid until the AG looked into things, then he decided that he didn't need the full membership, the non-practicing membership would be fine.  Dexter also bought himself several macs and cameras as well.  He is far from clean in this, and he doesn't get the credit for the investigation and charges either.

All expenses require receipts and constituency expenses are now posted online. The bad news: as the saying goes "one bad apple spoils the bunch". Our province has lost a lot of faith in public figures because of the actions of a few "bad apples".

It's also an opportunity for Nova scotia criminal penalties to be handed out to these criminals the same as they are to other Nova Scotians.  These people volunteered to become politicians, but after being elected, deemed themselves above the same laws that apply to those who voted them into office.  Who will be represented in the courts in April? The politicians?  Or the electorate!

There was proposed legislation last year that would immediately eject sitting memebers found guilty of criminal offences committed while in office and also it granted the house the power to strip an MLA of their pension if it was determined they committed a criminal office against taxpayers while serving in government.  I call for Dexter and his regime to immediately use their majority government to implement that proposed law and show Nova Scotian's they are serious about MLA expense reform and setting a new course for transparency in government.  My guess is he'll walk away from the problem and hire a committee to look at the matter.  That'll tell me all I needed to know.

The government can't seem to find funds for support services for low income families and women's organizations, but they can certainly find money for generators, fancy furniture and bank rolling crocks who are living high off the hog thanks to tax payers money!!  I'm happy to see that they are being held accountable for their actions. They should be treated like everyone else who breaks the law.

I don't think anyone here would argue that point.  As taxpayers, we are the owners of the business called Canada, and those same right should be a given. we should know how much we are paying each MP or MLA, how much of our money they are spending in addition to their pay and what benefits they produce for the country or province. We should also be able to fire them on the spot for any irregularities.  I wonder how many politicians we would have if full disclosure to the taxpayer were a prime requisite for holding the position?

N.S. has now found the same with their MLAs, HOWEVER, there is absolutely NO reason to suspect our federal MP's could possibly be doing the same illegal activities.  Even though they refuse to be audited by Shelia Frazer, I have the greatest of faith that our MP's only have the interests of their constituents and the proper allocation of our tax dollars in mind.  How do I know this?  The Prime Minister, Mr Harper, said so.  Is that not enough evidence that all is well on Capital Hill?  lol

First of all - it never was 'the Liberal Party' of Canada or anywhere else - except that the Liberal Party immediately ordered the legal inquiry to investigate.  The felons were a little group of Montreal fraudsters who set up a scheme to rip the country off - they WERE charged, they did get convicted.  I do get it that the conbots want to libel Cretien and anyone else who might take the real  heat off Harper any day of the week.  But - sigh - I wish the country would say to them: how about YOU guys setting up some inquiries into - oh: the G8 or G20; Afghan detainees; mega millions on all sorts of questionable projects; and anyone else can make up an even longer list.  posted  1:06pm ET

The noteable factor here is these criminals are almost always near the top of the food chain - not the bottom.

The daughter of the bankrupt owner started a new company a couple of months after this happened.  If you want to be involved in organized crime with immunity............join a political party.

There is a monumental difference between making a mistake, such as misunderstanding a complex and conflicting set of expense rules, and knowing defrauding the public. Not every MLA named by the AG for incorrectly submitting expenses commited a crime. In most cases, it was simply the result of poorly worded, out-dated, and conflicting policies and laws imposed by various governments over the years. Hopefully the new, unified rules will make sure these mistakes never happen again.  However, the four charged may have knowingly lied in order to prifit at the expense of the tax-payers. A different beast altogether.

The leader can disallow any candidate selected by the riding and can parachute in any candidate they want into the riding. So, you wind up only with candidates who toe the party line and fit into the corrupt, unelected gang that runs the party. The only way to effect change is to take over the leadership, but that would only happen if all party members were given an equal vote in choosing a new leader. There is far too much corruption in the current ‘voting delegate’ and convention method of selecting the party leader.

From the Canadian Taxpayers Federation:   Reform the MLA pension plan: Nova Scotia Spread the word by sending the petition link to your email contacts: http://www.taxpayer.com/node/13063.  PETITION To Nova Scotia’s political party leaders: MLA’s receive a pension plan that is far richer than anything taxpaying Nova Scotians receive. For every dollar contributed by an MLA, taxpayers contribute twenty-two dollars.   This kind of pension program is far too expensive for taxpayers to support, at a time when the government is running huge deficits and raising taxes.   We the undersigned demand that the current MLA pension plan be scrapped and replaced with an RRSP defined contribution plan in which taxpayers contribute no more than $1 for every $1 contributed by an MLA. We further demand that politicians who have abused their expenses while in office do not receive a taxpayer-funded pension.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PLEASE SIGN! Nova Scotians are being ripped off by our MLAs.

I lived in Quebec for a couple of years and I learned that the MPs don’t ask for raises they just take what they think they are worth.  I hope that the province of Nova Scotia makes and example of these people so strongly that it will convince all the others now and for many years to come that they should keep their fingers out of the funds.

It is interesting that the people we have elected think nothing of dipping their hot hands into the pot and steal from the mouths that feed them. They should all get long prison terms and have their pension funds taken away.

The AG did this completely independantly of the government. It was HIS decision and HIS decision only to go through this exercise (at the same time that Dexter was expensing two 4000.00 laptops, a 2000.00 camera and his barrister association fees). Having said that, there is no question that EACH and EVERY PARTY has some part to blame here and need to be ashamed. The 4 charged are only the 4 who got caught. I can guarantee you that most of the rest of them hand their face in the trough as well!

This issue is about our system and how it is broken and in need of repair and that is an issue for all politicians of all stripes but especially for the people of Canada to solve. There is not one political party that is immune from transgressions, not because we elect people that are out to fleece the taxpayer but because we have a system in place that allows such things to occur. A complete overhaul of the complete system is overdue but I have yet to see a political party, ANY political party, fully subscribe to fixing the problems. Whatever party that does so would be one that would entertain my vote but I won't hold my breath waiting. That "fix" would have to cover everything from wages, operating expenses, gifts and contributions, taxes, benefits, pensions, as well as a workable recall mechanism.   As employers we should demand those things and they should be within our rights to see.

Dexter, while politically stupid, wasn't illegal or unethical.  Former Conservative Cabinet Minister Michael Baker, who sadly passed away in 2009, did the same.  This impacted all parties to a degree.  However, I didn't see the Tories kicking out Hurlburt.  I didn't see the Liberals kick out Wilson.  At least the NDP, when they saw something wasn't right with Zinck, booted him from caucus which is why he's now an independent MLA.  We also must remember that there are currently 51 sitting MLA's out of 52 that haven't broken the law.  Now is the time to let the legal system do it's job.

Dexter did the right thing in coming clean, something Dave Dingwall, my former MLA, did not. Richard Hurlburt not only bought a generator, but a $5000 television set for his home as well. i suppose one was to keep the other running while NSPower increases rates and PRs many blackouts in stead of infrastructure upgrades.  this is not an NDP thing. it is not a Liberal thing and it is not a conservative thing. it is a political thing and all politicians must behave more appropriately.

Lets see how "transparent" the government really is, the real question will be, how far will they allow it to go. When Buchanon was accused of a little slight of hand, how did the PC government at the time respond? Appointed to the senate. As taxpayers we deserve to know where are tax dollars are going, I agree once again, force them to post their expenses and such online for public record. Guarenteed it will amount to the equivelant of a towns operating expenses for several years. As we are obviously heading into an election ( Con attack ads are a dead giveaway), wouldn't it be interesting to see the true cost of this election to the taxpayer. Total all costs of the election, before , during and after, including attack ads! The amounts would boggle the mind of those of us struggling to get by.

Do these people have any idea of the financial sacrifices he has made - as a partner in a law firm - to commit himself to serving the public for the past 10 years? Ask your own lawyer what he makes a day. It is much more than the leader of the opposition, or the premier. The same can be said of former premier Dr. John Hamm. He must have lost $100,000 per year to become leader of the third party, and then premier. Give  your heads a shake.

I have to hand it to Dexter. He pretty much did a perfect job of summing this up. Shame. Eroding public confidence (already at a low).

And Dexter's right about one thing "making it more difficult to encourage people to vote, run as candidates or support parties."

Strange how the RCMP could never find the people who paid the bribes to Basi and Virk even though they know who bought BC Rail.   Peculiar thing is nobody in BC expects the BC Liberals to pay the 6 million that they borrowed on behalf of BC taxpayers to pay their legal fees.  BC is becoming the 3rd banana republic within Canada but may soon become number one right after Nova Scotia.  I suspect BC lost a lot more money than the nickel and dimes Noba Scotia lost with this MLA expense fiasco.

A nation gets the leadership it deserves.   Besides,   86 % of Canadians in an anonymous survey admit  to stealing on the job at one time or another. Next time you look into a mirror ask yourself if you are part of the 86 %...                  And now ask also if these 4 goons were caught how many of our elected have stolen and were not caught.

You have to admit it's pretty hard to kick someone out of caucus when they're not there anymore. I'm sure Zinck was pressured to resign too--but he wouldn't have any of it. It's not exactly a mark of good character that he wouldn't do the 'honourable' thing and resign with his co-accused. Maybe it just rankles that the only accused MLA still serving in the Legislature (giving us the possible joy of having an MLA on trial) was once a proud member of the morally righteous NDP. And it may not stop there. Despite being Valentine's Day, I can't help but think Province House's greatest love story may have an unhappy ending for the NDP MLA for Halifax Atlantic.   On a conciliatory note, I completely agree with you on the legal fees. Dexter (and Baker, for that matter) shouldn't have done it from a political perspective, but I understand they were advised by the Speaker it was acceptable. Hard to blame them for that.

Here is the situation; We have a  rich country in natural resources, talents and business opportunities. Our politicians killing the most opportunities and our global competitiveness  by taxing us to death and misspending our taxes for their travel and hospitality expenses and billions of dollars of consulting contracts for the beloved consulting companies. In other words, we are paying for salary, benefits and travel and hospitality expenses of half million  as well as lease and rent of those government building plus they have created thousands of consulting companies on top of that to spend all of our money. More info at www.gc.ca  ---> department and agencies---> proactive disclosure  Regrettably, the watchdogs are insiders: the head of Transparency International is a former Canadian federal Public servant and auditor General obviously a public servant.   What you can do for Canada:  Each and every one of you should be a wikileaks.ca or facebook anti corruption leader. Gather information, distribute it and invite your friends to your anti corruption facebook groups.  You may use  name such as " Lean Government"" tax free Canada" " Transparency Canada" " Say No  to Redundant Government"   My fellow citizens, thats the only way we can save Canada in the new competitive world.   Start the revolution today.  Your friend, Che

We get what we vote for and I hope soon a person will come along and say enough is enough and throw out all the bums out .I want my children and there children to have a future in Nova Scotia with  an honest government. Is this to much to hope for?

In the past owning up to a 'mistake' after the fact was ok and you could pay back the portion you got caught stealing...I mean the portion you mistakenly put into your pocket. I hope this practice ends and prosecutors are more aggressive in serving the public interest on this.   What I really want to know is if that uber plush 5% per year pension that they qualify for after only six years of service is forfeit also - as it should be.  Regarding MLA pensions we're being stolen from every day.  5% per yr eligible after only six yrs = a 30% pension based on best 3yrs earning.  Imagine finding any other job that offers that pension perk!!  Consider that after 15yrs an MLA walks with a 75% pension, do you even want to know what the base salary is for an MLA!?  Fat pensions were suppos to entice professionals and offset career gains in their professional feild for the short time they chose to serve the public. It just didn't happen folk, look at the CVs of the current slate of MLAs.

First what Canadians need to do is ‘pay attention’ to all inappropriate padding of expenditures by elected officals AND irresponsible and unnecessary expenditures by governments. Whether we communicate through facebook, tweeter, emails, et al, individuals have these transgressions be addressed regardless of who is responsible, or where they occur…    I listened to a local radio program this morning, the topic - increasing the GST for infrastructure. The particular focus… sports arenas! The classic infrastructure, public transit, bridges, roads, sidewalks, water, sewage are crumbling in every city, but some recommending we use taxes to build coliseums… Not dissimilar from the Romans using  gladiators to distract the people from the corrupt complacency of their Emperors!     The norm is that governments no longer monitor, nor care, about responsible management of existing taxes. We need to be 'loud and clear' that we will not accept ANY increase in taxes until ALL governments demonstrate they are committed to eliminate grossly irresponsible expenditures.   The system is rotten to the core… it’s not only the billions for war, the millions for the G8/G20 (under the guise of a stimulus) but the thousands of small expenditures that add up to hundreds of millions!    An election won't solve THIS issue… because there are too many politicians, in all parties, who close a blind eye to this negligence.    (4:45)

What is he, six years old? That ship sailed years ago.   The truth is, whenever a politician gets in trouble, the rest of them, regardless of party, pull their wagons in a circle and shout how good of a person this politician is and it all must be a misunderstanding.  They do this to protect their image. The effect has been anything but protecting their image.  If politicians had more intellect, they would realize they lost their credibility a few generations back and it is going to take a lot of work to regain people's trust.    The first step would be to make mandatory jail sentences for any politician breaking the law. The next would be to introduce a law making the breach of trust of office the most serious offense. Those convicted of this separate charge would have to serve that sentence consecutive to any other sentence.   After all, if you are all the bright shining angels you claim to be, why would this be a problem? Good people don't steal from the cookie jar so you are perfectly safe.

I think the audit division should be larger in the government to investigate all sorts of frauds to our tax payer dollars.  First audit the politicians, employees and then the tax payer themselves.  It drives me nuts when people try to get money out of the government for no reason.  I mean really - if anyone was handed a cheque for $1000 from the government for doing nothing - would you cash it?
