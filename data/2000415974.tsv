We are lightyears behind the US on this, there is so much competition there that unlimited plans are the norm. Here we have to pay a boatload of money for the same thing.  This woman is wrong, usage based billing needs to go. i know this is in regards to smaller ISPs renting bandwidth, but it applies to every ISP. Drop usage based billing.

It's not based on an upcoming election. It was based on due process."  ---  Well Mme. Bertrand, I suppose I like the idea of the government trying to please voters more than the CRTC trying to please Big Telecom.  You may want us to sit down and shut up, but I choose not to, and if I need to go through my MP, the PM, and opposition leaders/critics to do that, I will damned well exercise that right.  Does the CRTC take public input?  Yes.  Are our voices as loud as Bell's well-funded voice?  I highly doubt it.

Charging over 20 times the true cost of the bandwith is not in the best interest of Canadians.  The CRTC should have considered both sides of the equation before siding with the companies.

Bertrand has been out of the position for a decade, therefore, this news story has all the earmarks of a drive by smear and the CBC seems intent on filling the tank with unleaded.

You should have remained silent and thanked the stars that you the current head and past board members of the CRTC have not been charged with working against the interest of the Canadian people over the past several decades.    You have been part of the shills for big business who have maintained the monopoly by the Bell, Rogers and Telus over telecom in this country to the point where we in Canada now have some of the highest rates anywhere for less service and lacking inovatice products & service that come from competition.  So keep quite as we don't really care what you think.

If the government doesn't like the ruling they are the ones who write the rules so change the law.  But they can't because they only represent 1/3 of Canadians and the other 2/3 realize that the rules must be followed.

Let Parliament vote on these matters so that we can contact our MPs and weigh in on issues.  Tony Clement is right to tell the CRTC what the government wants done.  It is likely that a majority of Canadians are unhappy with the CRTC --- so isn't it time to fix it?

Then tell them why this is bad for the voters, apparently they think it is good idea.  If you think the people of Canada and the Canadian government is wrong on this decision, tell us why you think that.  Complaining that they interfered in the decision is pointless if you can't prove them wrong.  ""The CRTC's great advantage was it was giving the possibility for the government to have an institution at arm's length," she said."  That actually is now their biggest disadvantage. No accountability. I can't vote them out, neither can you...  We tried that system, it clearly doesn't work.

Bell/Telus, Rogers, XplorNet, all need to be reigned in and even in some cases considered for criminal investigation.  XplorNet is by far the worst offender of all.  They, as a result of thier low revenue, are exempt from a public complaints process with the CRTC.  Despite the government hand outs they receive.  Sorry Scott, I just have to tell the truth.

When the CRTC asked for comment on this issue, we overwhelmingly spoke against usage caps of this kind, but they ruled in favour of it anyway because they're corrupt. After the reversal, even Bell was forced to admit that their push for usage caps and usage-based billing was largely groundless.  What recourse do we have, but to have our elected representatives step in and force the CRTC into line when they misbehave this way? Yes it is disturbing that the government stepped in, but not for the reason you state; what's disturbing is that they had to.  This should be ringing alarm bells about the state of the CRTC for you, Ms. Bertrand, not the state of the government.

However, the ruling was a result of lobbying efforts by Bell and served no purpose but to increase profits.    If the public outcry was loud enough to convince the governemnt to step in to reverse the decision, something was clearly wrong.

Secondly, she is missing the mandate of the CRTC which was to protect the interests of consumers; a mandate that was altered by cabinet/ministerial decree.  Third, Canada is still at the back of the pack in telecom for competitiveness, service and technology in the developed world.  Her opinions are contrary to the interests of Canadians but not big business.  YAWN

Put this into a different light and see how it feels. What if, hypothetically, the commision in charge of shipping those nuclear steam boilers ruled it was unsafe according to current laws, and a minister stepped in and said 'psshh its safe, ship em'... Would you feel the same way as you do about UBB being overturned?  Its not the right way to go about things, the laws that lead/allowed the commisions to make these decisions need to be changed to reflect the will of the people.  Again, I'm not saying the decision to overturn the UBB ruling was bad, quite the opposite. But the reality is that Ottawa needs to get its crap together, and actually REFORM the CRTC so they cannot make a mistake like this again, so that the industries that work underneath their leadership have a clear idea of what to expect.

She was the CEO of Tele Quebec before taking the post at the CRTC. How can anyone that has held a post for a company which is under CRTC jurisdiction be non biased in their interpretation and implementation of industry standards? Common sense dictates that they are going to favour their particular field and even worse cater to their old friends. The CRTC should not be staffed with ex executives from the Television and Radio community but with outsiders with no conflict. Be quiet Mrs Bertrand your term is completed.

That totally misses the point. The appropriate role for the government is to change the law that led to the decision, not to interfere with the decision itself.   The CRTC is like a court - it administers due process based on the law. I'd like to think people wouldn't support government interference with a court process - by the same token, the government should not interfere with the decision-making by administrative tribunals like the CRTC.

Throughout her career, Françoise Bertrand has served on the board of directors of numerous organizations. She is currently a member of the board of Québécor Inc., CSST, FIDEC, and Montreal’s Club Saint-Denis.   ******************* I think the above is telling enough.  Ms. Bertrand, once you represent REAL CANADIAN CONSUMERS  maybe then your musings on this matter may be relevant  It is however interesting to note that when Chairperson of the CRTC the following was stated:  The CRTC Will Not Regulate the Internet Results 1 b, 2 b  "The CRTC is the first regulator in the world to clarify its position on the Internet."  Françoise Bertrand, CRTC Chairperson, May 17, 1999  After an extensive process on the state of new media in Canada and their domestic and global potential, the CRTC concluded that the new media services on the Internet are achieving the goals of the Broadcasting Act and are vibrant, highly competitive and successful without regulation. The CRTC also concluded that most of the information on the Internet is alphanumeric and is therefore excluded from the definition of broadcasting. However, while some audio and visual products and services carried out on the Internet constitute broadcasting, they will be exempt from regulation because the Commission is satisfied that to license these services would not contribute in a material manner to the implementation of the broadcasting policy for Canada.

What a crazy concept, serving public interests. No, it's far better to base decisions on the requests of big money lobbyists trying to retain their stranglehold on the market.  How else are we going to keep our reputation of paying more and getting less for telecom services than most other countries in the world, including our big brother down south.   Heaven forbid that someone actually questions the decisions of the all-knowing CRTC, let alone have the nerve to make them go back and review their decisions.    It's about time public servants actually SERVED the interests of the public. Yes to the new mobile providers, IPS's and everything in between.  Great to see to see someone is holding CRTC accountable.

Since when did the public have any respect for the CRTC, the Canadian Radical Tariff Corporation who acts on behalf of the Cable, TV, Radio and Communication Corporations.  You know, the same corporations who are getting the corporate tax cuts from both the Federal Conservatives as well as the Provincial BC Liberals.  Yes, the public should just stand down and respect whatever the CRTC has to say or do for these poor, hard done by, corporations that are being persecuted by the tax payers.

The move by the CRTC to bend to the will to the likes of Bell in their attempt to squeeze out competition and overcharge users for a product that is actually is getting cheaper to provide proves just how independant the CRTC really is.  As an earlier post by another she actually sits on the Board of one of the companies that is attempting to oversharge users to inflate their bottom line.  Just how independant are her views? This is just another example of how the CRTC has moved away from their intended purpose and must be overhauled or a referendum should be held to see if Canadians still believe the CRTC is viable.

The government stepped in because Canadian's ASKED THEM TO, because the CRTC didn't listen.  Do you not understand that people are livid. They are tired of being ripped off by the telco's.  You as a former head of the CRTC speaking out against the government adds more proof that this agency is a waste of tax payer dollars and should be disbanded.   The agency is nothing more than a mouthpiece for Bell, Telus, Rogers etc.. not the people or the smaller ISP's.

We either try to find more resources, depleting them in the process, or adapt our lifestyles by better using what we have.

Over time people can expect technology breakthroughs to better utilize all of the process' that take place when people access the net, whether its through their desktop, laptop, mobile phone, etc...

It might be a near-limitless as the process becomes more refined but just as you can have unlimited water or natural resource you can't have unlimited upload/download.    I'm not for or against usage-based billing; I'm against people having "unlimited" upload/download.

The Harper government installed this particular CRTC board to ensure a corporate agenda.  Now that the CRTC have ratified that agenda with usage-based billing at the expense of the consumer, the public backlash has forced Harper and his crew of idiots to reverse the CRTC decision.  Without a doubt the CRTC ruling was wrong for Canada, but undermining it is purely a political move by the Conservatives.  The CRTC and the Harper crew are both wrong, but this is a case of two wrongs actually making a right!

The third party ISPs have no investment in the infrastructure that supplies the internet, only in a bunch of salesmen and lobbyists that peddle a product the rest of us subsidize.    Competition would allow subscribers to get their product from more than one base supplier.  Then we would really see the rates come down as the primary vendors compete with each other. Instead, they have parcelled out the market so that there is no real competition.  Letting the third parties sell cheap bandwidth that slows down the  service the rest of us get is wrong.   Pay for what you use. Open up the market so that the primary providers compete with each other.

And the independence that the CRTC holds is not only independent from the government, but also greatly independent from the opinions of the vast majority of Canadian voters and consumers as well. Obviously the concerns of the numbers of Canadians are far outweighed by the concerns of the few monopolistic telecom companies in which Canadian are complaining about.  Funny, she didn't have any decisions overturned during her term. Most likely because she didn't do anything as questionable as these recent events.  Even funnier, when she left her post 10 years ago, "she was credited with giving the public a greater say in broadcast and telecommunications policy." - Toronto Star, Dec. 5, 2000 (http://www.friends.ca/news-item/6577)  So the work she did then to allow us a greater voice, which we as Canadians have used to compel the government to overturn this ruling by the very CRTC she worked for, disturbs her?  That makes her a hypocrite no?  I wish I could QUIT a job and still have a say in it a decade later...

They have a responsibility to issue regulations against usage-based billing, not in favour of it.  The Conservative government has a responsibility to act in the best interests of the people of Canada. UBB does not serve the people. It serves corporate interests, profiteering, and does nothing to support our economy or improve our infrastructure.  The CRTC is also not doing it's due diligence in investigating the merits of UBB and the claims being made almost exclusively by Bell and the other "players" in the Canadian Telecom industry.  The CRTC was completely in the wrong over it's decision to allow UBB and then and only then is the Conservative government welcome (and indeed tasked) with reacting to the CRTCs decision.  This has nothing to do with partisan agenda, it is merely the government doing it's job. (It only took them 5 years to get there...).  Canada has the most restrictive Telecom industry and rapidly one of the least technologically advanced.  UBB is not the answer. Charging the customer more and more for less and less is not the definition of fair and honest trade.  Open the floodgates and let Verizon absorb the Canadian Telecoms, or have them fight back with fair and balanced pricing based on the quality of service.

It should not be beholden to the government in power, nor subject to their pre-election whims. Harper's flagrant disregard for the rule of law is appalling.  HOWEVER, the CRTC is also broken on both sides. It is not free of government interference (obviously), but much more seriously, it is not independent of the corporate media interests. It is continually making decisions for the benefit of the largest media corporations, and NOT for the good of the public.  Rather than fighting decisions like this one-on-one (and without the benefit of the law behind you), Harper should actually tackle this like a leader:  First of all, remove von Finkelstein and the rest of the decision-makers at the CRTC. There should be no one left, other than the technical, administrative, and maintenance staff.  Next, a temporary board should be established with members from all parties, the public, and the media interests (big and small ISPs, Telcos, cable station owners, and content creators, i.e. artists). They would need to define a clear charter for the CRTC, and then appoint the permanent board with representatives from all of their own groups. This board would then be explicitly free of government or corporate influence.  Finally, a watchdog with real teeth would need to be established, and audit the new CRTC continually.  Alas, it won't happen. Canadian culture will be sold to Bell, and then Bell will be sold to AT&T.

If the cost I was charged was anywhere near the actual cost. Being charged $2 per GB when the actual cost is mere pennies, or less, is what you get when there is a monopoly using government regulation to prevent competition. If the infrastructure costs make the market monopolistic by nature then it needs to be nationalized and government regulated. If not, there needs to be competition (which there isn't).  Anyone who believes they are paying higher rates because of other users is simply naive.

It was probably a very good idea for them to back usage based internet billing when taken from the point of view of the corporations.  This decision would have made the little businesses more profitable and the bigger ones even more so all at the expense of the public.  I thought the CTRC was supposed to be working to help the consumer, not backing the big corporations.  This whole thing really helped to show the details behind their decision making processes.  Our big telecommunications giants are not ready to deal with the inevitable move from cable television to steaming video and they want systems in place to remove that option from the table, that is all this is about.  Canada is already decades behind in technology, internet, wireless infrastructure, and while the US is pledging billions to advancing their infrastructure, we are trying to put a limit on what we can use the internet for?  I think THAT is what is truly 'disturbing'.  If you are not going to protect the consumer from this kind of backwards thinking then you have outlived your usefulness.

According to our telecom legislation foreign owned companies aren't allowed to own or operate companies. Rogers and Bell like free markets & less regulation, with the exception of allowing foreign and more competitive companies operating in Canada.  Therefore it would only hurt Rogers or Bell, who seem content on raising prices without any addition benefit in services!

Just a fraction of users use over 80% of the bandwith; that is who UBB targets.  It would relieve congestion and pay for expanding the network for additional bandwith.  The only alternative Bell now has is to throttle everyone and good on them for doing so.

The CRTC decision must be reversed and the broadband market continue to be open to competition.  Net neutrality is core to the functions of our society and must be maintained.  Large telecom companies have the technology to handle current higher bandwidth needs and are making excessive profits as is.

I am writing because similar principles of disclosure should apply when the comments of a former public official are published. Mme. Bertrand should have mentioned, or the writer should have pointed out, that she sits on the board of Quebecor Inc.With that knowledge it is no surprise that she will not stay mum on the issue.It is in Quebecor's interest, and that of other incumbents such as Bell(more than likely a key member of at least one of the Quebec Chambers of Commerce that she administers), that the UBB decisions in question remain in place.They want UBB pricing imposed on independent ISPs such as TekSavvy because a)they can fix prices at an artificially high level(and keep the UBB fees that independent ISPs are forced to charge), reaping windfall profits and b) they can limit TekSavvy's ability to compete, putting Canadians at the mercy of incumbent-set pricing that bears no relationship to undelying costs. Mme. Bertrand, like everyone else in Canada, is entitled to her opinion. However in view of her relationship with Quebecor it is hardly worth noting. In any case, either she or the writer should have pointed that out.This is not statesmanship, it is public relations.

Mme Bertrand's point is that the government is bending the rules to react to a particular whim of public opinion, instead of FIXING the rule they had to bend in the first place. So what happens next time? They have to bend the rules again.  You might as well not have a CRTC if the government is just going to step in every single time the board makes a ruling the government doesn't like. Either clarify the regulations, or butt out.  If they want to allow Wind to operate in Canada, change the REGULATIONS. If they want to ban usage billing, change the REGULATIONS. Don't just keep ordering the CRTC to "go back to the drawing board" when they try to enforce the REGULATIONS the government has control over.

The Internet represents the future economy, without a doubt. Throttling it down so a few corporations can present shareholders with higher dividends is an outrage.   I could understand Bell, Rogers, and Shaw's position if they were financially unable to keep up with bandwidth demand. But each of these companies make a higher net income than ANY of the major European or American Internet providers. Their profit levels, especially when compared to total revenue, are ridiculous. They abuse their monopoly, which is protected by each provinces utility services, by charging more and more for their services without investing anything close to a similar amount into their infrastructure.  Google, among others, has a strong desire to compete with these companies. In California, they're building an ultra-fast fiber-optics network. However, Canada's companies have a government protected monopoly. They have a regulatory body who's chairman responsible for telecommunication worked over a decade each for both Rogers and Bell.  Coporations that take shortcuts, write their own rules, and abuse their corrupt insider influences for profit have to be stopped. Bell, Rogers, and Shaw - that means you.

The CRTC made a poor decision, the people have spoken and the government listened.  We don't want usage-based interent billing, we got past that in the 90's and it's a regressive system.

In the day and age of corporate gouging, usage-based billing opens the door to those willing to stick it to the littel guy.

If, on the other hand, you feel there is a need for such independent bodies, and you hire the right people and give them the tools to become experts, and the right policies and legislation to do a good job, then trust the decisions they make and back off.  Otherwise, be prepared for the sort of cherry-picking that leaves the judiciary and industry unable to determine what is legal or not.

She is not supporting the usage based billing decision.  It has nothing to do with the internet or the decisions made by CTRC.    She is simply stating that from an operational point of view, if the government does not agree with the decision of the CTRC, they should not override it, but instead should make new laws or amend old ones, or change the role of the CRTC.  Simply forcing them to reverse their decision whether the decision is right or wrong would simply cause confusion.    Now in the future, business would not know whether to look to the CRTC for the final decision or if they should wait a few days to see if the government will force the CRTC to reverse their decision.    Also having the CRTC would be like having the senate if they are not really making any decision since it seems that all the decision making is coming from parliament

As far as I'm concerned the CRTC long ago outlived their usefulness, and they have now become a shill for corporate profits over what is right for Canadian consumers.   If the original decision was the right decision, why is that Canadians are paying the highest rates for both the Internet and cellular services, for far less service levels? I'll tell you why, it is because the CRTC has decided that corporate profits trumps the rights of Canadians to receive services at  reasonable rates like they do in both the U.S.A. and the EU. The CRTC has taken a tact to help these corporate predators eliminate competition, and sadly the CRTC is not even embarrassed by this obvious bias. Therefore, it is time to abolish this archaic band of appointees and insert some real competition into the Canadian marketplace.

Have a look at your cable bill over the years! It is outrageous. Now the cable companies buy up the TV stations, decontent them and try to force us to keep paying higher and higher rates, while at the same time making record profits.  So people start watching online and Netflix. See the timing here? Netflix scares the pants off of the cable companies because we can CHOOSE what WE want to watch WHEN we WANT to watch it! When I told Shaw I would cut my cable for Netflix, the first thing the agent told me was net metering.

CPC is against any regulation yet CRTC is a regulator that decides the limits of the corporate power, in this case Bell. When CPC arrived in power it stacked the CRTC with with appointments connected to the party after which Bell has every decision go their way. People get angry, there are petitions flying around, then politicians get involved... and here comes indignant PM Harper who with a  wave of his hand makes it all go in favor of the public. Everybody's pissed at CRTC and wants it gone, while Harper gleefully awaits the upcoming election with populist anger in his back pocket. Pretty brilliant strategy for the CPC, a win-win. Unfortunately this whole thing is clever yet on another level since the CRTC, under admitted pressure from the PMO, works quietly to dissolve regulations even more important than unbridled profiteering and with public attention elsewhere. Search around about the upcoming change to regulations that forbid lying in the news. Why would anyone want to allow lies in the news? Start thinking critically people - your Canada is slipping away.

Horse feathers – she is being paid to speak out on behalf of business. It’s her job as President of the Federation of Quebec Chambers of Commerce.  The government’s action to stop usage based Internet fees is, undoubtedly, a blow to the big telecommunications companies long used to having their demands rubber-stamped. The Big 4 just don’t get it – the halcyon days of ever greater customer gouging their are over – the public will no longer stand for it. They are aware that we are paying premium prices for inferior service when compared to the rest of the world. The public knows that the excess revenues intended by the government to build infrastructure was used to pay executive bonuses, increase shareholder value, and buy out competitors.   The Harper government, if nothing else, is acutely aware of public moods in their continued trolling for votes. They have decided that there was no way to spin the CRTC decision and no way to dodge the wrath of the public with the threat of an election hanging over them. Interestingly, the government’s first instinct is to blame the Liberals and, in this case, they merely continued the policies of the former government.   While it may arguably have been in the country’s best interest to allow the fledgling telecoms the revenues to survive and expand, the mature companies no longer need nurturing by the government – they’re just used to it. It’s no longer a necessary crutch but the telecoms have become addicted to outrageous profits and domination of the CRTC. This may be a double whammy - they may have to compete with their own unlimited plans rather than driving the small ISPs out of the market

If the regulator was staffed with people who were interested in creating competition, and not people who ran Bell for years then it would actually be a force for the country's good. As it is now it serves only to legitimize every monopolistic practice of Canada's oligarchy.

They are as bad as the RIAA and the MPAA, and should very much be disbanded, or at least have their mandate changed significantly.

I like her argument that the government should have got involved ´upstream´.   However her opinions don´t get to the roots of the political problem:  - use of near-monopoly powers to neglect infrastructure for short term profit and  - higher prices in Canada for services that are cheaper in other countries.  Clement may have gone off at half-cock for insisting the UBB decision be reversed. But his political and economic instincts were right.   I hope the government changes the law to allow more foreign investment into Canada. If we like what it does, we invest too. This is one upside of globalization. If the Tories also move to do something about police behavior, they will have earned my vote.

This is an issue before the voters.  In case you don`t know, the playing field is not the same for each provider. Bell, gets hammered by the CRTC and cannot compete on the same level as everyone else.

It is time for a huge influx of competition and the elimination of the obviously  corporately owned and controlled CRTC.

If the public disagrees with the law (on this matter, or the matter of cell companies), then lobby your MP to get the law changed. Cabinet should then listen to the people and change the law.  But ragging on the CRTC for doing their job, i.e. impartially applying the current law without political interference, is simply stupidity. If the shoe was on the other foot and the government was overturning a popular decision by the CRTC for some political goal, the public would (rightfully) be screaming bloody murder. We need arms length bodies like the CRTC to apply regulations, and demanding its dissolution because you disagree with the law that they didn't write is just boneheadedness.

The only thing UBB would protect is Big Telco, by eliminating choice and competition and imposing abhorrent pricing models and restrictions.  3) The government has the right to reverse or order changes to any CRTC ruling within 90 days. The entire government heard the outcry from Canadians and did what they needed to do to correct a serious error on the part of the CRTC.  4) The CRTC is about as arms length as an overcrowded elevator insofar as their stance with Big Telco. Most of the CRTC board members are picked from... Big Telco. Does it surprise anyone that they would fully support UBB?
