The Liberals spend their time trying to woo voters from the NDP while trying to hold onto the center right voters. It just is not possible for this to succeed and Canada deserves better choice than choosing their center left party from the NDP and the Liberals. The NDP will never see power and the Liberals are fading fast. Time to create a new party that effectively swallows these two and can ensure Canadians that a Con majority will remain a dream.CommentKey:5c690957-2d57-4962-a77b-990d3892eaac	2000415568	Fri Feb 11 2011 17:18:39 GMT-0500 (EST)	Micnic	94	"Amazing!

There WILL NOT be an election and we WILL NOT have our sorry butts handed to us by the voters like we so richly deserve.  Listen, you all know that Stephen Harper ALWAYS blows it whenever he comes close to majority territory. He works like a dog for two to three years trying to put the pieces in place but he ALWAYS screws it up. ALWAYS!  And that's exactly what he's done AGAIN! Minister Oda has been caught red-handed signing forged documents denying funding to an aid group which her own department approved.  So, everyone please, just go back to what you were doing. There is NO cause for concern here. We will NOT have to come up with a coherent, sensible policy platform, or an inspiring leader, or any of that stuff.   We can just keep fumbling and stumbling along, aimlessly grasping at any little straw and trying to invent a crisis out of it and hope that we can somehow convince enough voters that we still matter as a party.  Yes, I know; the Canadian people will have to suffer through a little while longer with a corrupt, deceitful, mean-spirited government that tries mightily to hide what it really is but can never quite seem to and an inept, incompetent opposition that couldn't hit a bull on the butt with a bass fiddle.

First, like it or not, the Conservatives continue to be masters of framing their opposition, be it in attack ads, or through sympathetic media (and this is before the launch of Fox News North). Second, unless you are a political junkie, I think most Canadian don't pay attention to what goes on in Ottawa.  The corporate tax issue should be a vote winner for both the Liberals and the NDP, and yet even this simple issue seems to not be resonating with average Canadians. At the same, the Conservatives' ""tough of crime"" agenda excites their base, despite the reams of data from the US that demonstrate quite clearly what a failure mandatory minimum sentences have been. Not to mention these useless F-35 fighters. Yes, useless. They are strike fighters, not the long range reconnaissance fighters Canada actually needs.

Yes, and I only wish it were true.  Polls in the last federal campaign were pretty darn close. Not so close int eh last Ontario election. However, generally, they are good. No poll is going to show the Conservatives leading by 10 one day, but have the Liberals win two days later by 9. I think an overlooked significant factor in declines in voter turnout are accuracy of polls. Why look for your polling station, stand in line, often have temporary workers treat you poorly, etc, when media and polling firms have gotten together to tell you what the general result will be?  Especially if the person also feels like all governments cheat the public anyway....  But two things happen during a campaign. The party that had been in government has to justify why they should get their vote again. How they will fix past mistakes, and what new plans they want to put into action. Opposition parties have to stop knee-jerk opposition and come up with plans of their own.  Past records obviously come into play, but there is also the question of what grabs peoples' attention at the moment.   Ignatieff may feel he needs an election even if the poll numbers don't look good. If he gets a good idea that will resonate with people at the time they need to vote for somebody, it could improve their fortunes. Currently, I don't see them winning. Losing the election could lose Ignatieff his job, but not fighting one could also lose him his job. Liberal disarray helps the Conservatives and the NDP.

""While the Canadian consumer is still going strong, the sharp divergence in exports versus imports points to a rotation from domestic led economic growth toward export led growth,"" TD Bank economist Diana Petramala said of the results, in a note.  Despite the divisive rhetoric being spewed into this forum by the Liberals and the NDP - (pre election empty garbage and name calling) the Conservatives are well ahead in support according to all Canadian pollsters. Despite continual and constant Media attacks and scare tactics, a constant stream of Liberal and NDP stereotypical attacks on Harper's character, The Conservatives now hold a 12½-point lead  over the Liberals.  Michael Ignatieff is a political opportunist. My bet is the Liberal war room is now in freeze frame mode praying the NDP support the March budget. Does Jack Layton want a Conservative majority?

If the polls go immediately up for the governing party when the Liberals and the NDP start talking tough about an election, think of how much more the Conservatives will benefit if the Opposition actually does force an election that the mainstream of the Canadian electorate clearly does not want at this time.  The Liberals and the NDP are now between a rock and a hard place.  They will again have to eat crowe after their latest wave of election threats, making their promises look even more unbelievable, and yet the governing party is in a position of even greater strength in daring the Opposition to vote down its budget without necessitating the government having to either raise taxes or to increase spending in order to please those who think that bigger government is the answer to the economy.  The Opposition will be reduced to withdrawing its demands, all the while they make little or no impact on present government policy.  This will only feed the impression that makes the government look increasingly stronger, and the opposition will look increasingly weaker and ineffective.  The opposition parties should be able to do better in opposing a minority government that has been in power for 5 years.  I predict that there will now be an outcry from the public for the opposition toget their act together, and to cease and desist from making big boasts but following up with no actions at all."CommentKey:29f5672f-d915-4d98-ac1a-b185b7992976	2000415568	Sat Feb 12 2011 00:17:25 GMT-0500 (EST)	JasonAllan	5	SecondOpinion 11:57 PM  $6 billion EXTRA in corporate tax cuts and the HST would mean just the opposite but the Harper form of favouritism allows for opinions like yours no matter how erroneous.

And once again, as every poll in the past five years has demonstrated, the overwhelming Majority of Canadians are not behind the current regime and will not be voting for them. An election today would yield the same result, only this time the opposition will be prepared, and will present the GG with a plan for governing that represents the Majority. And the CONs will whine and cry when they read, or hear that, and complain that somehow, despite historical precedence and the fact our whole system is set up to accommodate them, coalitions are somehow illegitimate. Which in turn will demonstrate to most Canadians that most CON voters do not understand our parliamentary system, and have no idea what they are talking about.

Not one poll has suggested a coalition would defeat the conservatives. In fact, just the opposite. The idea of a coalition only strengthens CPC support. Time to get in tune with what Canadians want to replace the current government and the current opposition has failed to do that. That is the reality that is reflected in the polls.

These positions put Clark at odds with the right-wing members of his caucus, several members of which were not afraid to confront him.

This is a huge mistake.  Religious right-wing ideologues represent people who don`t want to think, but follow simplistic solutions to complex problems. That was how Bush won and that is what keeps the cons on top in the polls.  The Harper record is developing much like the Bush legacy did. One of many examples is the foreign policy blunder of unconditionally supporting Israel in any circumstance, thereby alienating so many Arab and African countries. This is the type of simplistic thinking that weakens Canada abroad (e.g. U.N. sec council) and divides us internally.  It has taken Obama a lot of effort to rebuild U.S. relations and it will take a long time to rebuild Canada after Harper, especially if the cons actually get a majority to wreak even more havoc. We just can`t allow this to happen.  It`s just that simple."CommentKey:93e4fb03-e423-49f1-8a47-78b2469dfaa2	2000415568	Sat Feb 12 2011 07:11:51 GMT-0500 (EST)	Filthy MacNasty	8	"COMMONERSSAY wrote: ""This Conservative gov't may not be all things to all people but Canadians are realizing that they provide competent and scandal free governing; that's a minimum that Canadians expect and had not received from successive Liberal gov'ts""  Competent and Scandal free?

What will that accomplish if we do not like the results, and then seek to subvert and to undermine the democratic process after the elections?  There will be no democratic solution to any nation if people do not respect the democratic process.  This is a serious situation, and is strong evidence that democracy cannot work just anywhere.  It takes a certain kind of virtue, and a certain kind of mindset for democracy to work.  We must have respect for the opinions and rights of others, and not undermine the will of the people if the people's choice is other than ours.  With mindsets such as some of those that have been expressed here, we are heading on a path to chaos if we do not respect the democratic process, and eventually people will be crying out for a strongman dictator to restore order and civil peace.

I personally get a kick out of the Con ad with Harper working late and alone.  I think putting some captions in there, like 'Damn this freaking sudoku!' would be appropriate.  Or following it with a caption like 'Working alone.  What Stephen Harper does best!'  The attack ads are much more effective, in my view.  They are not scandalous and dishonest; contrarily, they are alarming and honest.  Iggy is a smug leader who really doesn't give two craps about Canada.  I believed that before the attack ads  I think the Libs need to disspell election talk, fire their leader, and have a real leadership campaign if they want to be serious about becoming the government again.  Only in this way will they generate interest and excitement about their party; as is, Cons are demolishing them in fundraising (2-1), the Cons have a more cogent and clear narrative, and the Cons have a better leader (shocking, I know!).

This would give Canadians a clear alternative to the Conservatives."CommentKey:f9708ae0-c409-4323-ad4e-43fef4665c86	2000415568	Sat Feb 12 2011 10:42:00 GMT-0500 (EST)	raininbc	8	if this was an accurate poll..as opposed to a fixed one..Harper would be calling an election...EKOS is not a reputable polling company...they have shown many times that their results don't resemble reality..but we can hope that Harper calls an election soon...so we can kick his sorry a$$ out of officeCommentKey:b6fa7c39-2c21-481c-a315-b1ac99d63891	2000415568	Sat Feb 12 2011 10:45:21 GMT-0500 (EST)	PeterDN	24	"canadaawakening wrote:Posted 2011/02/12 at 7:52 AM ET  ""Some of you are stating openly that if the Harper government is re-elected, that you will not accept the outcome, and will do everything in your power to subvert and to undermine it."" … … ""Just because you do not like the outcome of a democratic process does not give you a right to impose your will upon others in a way that does not respect their right to hold an opinion different from yours.""  ----------------------------------  Excellent post!

For example, the Liberals could win votes from the Cons fiscal conservative base by attacking government intervention in corporate takeovers.  The Cons blocked more corporate acquisitions in 5 years than Liberals did in 15 years.  The Libs could win votes this way, especially in the east, which they NEED to win.  The Libs could win votes by attacking the deficit.  However, the deficit was created by lowering the GST.  And it probably won't go away until the GST is raised again, sad but true. Tough sell there, raising taxes.  Instead, the Libs focus on fighter jets that we need anyways?  Total lack of direction and leadership in the Liberal Party on this one.  They blather about 'open tenders' when that does not even make sense.  There are only a few companies in the world that manufacture fighter jets, and only one of them would guarantee Canadians jobs.  That's it, that's all.  Anyone who needs to know more is a moron. (I am talking to Iggy and Jack there!) Or they focus on other nonsense like corporate tax cuts, something the Libs of years past would have supported at such a time.  Won't lose them votes, but it is not going to win them votes either!  The Cons are a shade smarter.  They take positions to save and gain votes.  Unfortunately, they often do this in a ham-handed way, like the recent case of them ignoring the law and allowing Wind Mobile to set up shop rather than doing the rational thing and CHANGING the law to allow more companies to set up shop, driving consumer prices down in the process.

Their track record speaks for itself. It’s a legacy of arrogance, corruption, financial mismanagement, and misguided public policies.  Let us all remember and not forget …  Mismanagement: In 2000, an internal audit found that Jean Chrétien's Liberal government had failed to track employment program grants worth $1 billion to make sure the money was spent properly and the promised jobs were created.   Unethical Leadership: Prime Minister Jean Chrétien's tried to secure a personal $2 million dollar loan from federal Business Development Bank of Canada to finance two of his investment properties (Auberge Grand-Mère resort; Grand-Mère Golf Course) located in his home riding of Shawinigan.   Corruption: In infamous Liberal Sponsorship, it was revealed that the Liberals had conducted illicit and even illegal activities within the administration of the program, involving self serving misuse and misdirection of public funds intended for government advertising in Quebec.  Government Waste: In 2002, the Auditor-General of Canada, reported that the Canadian Firearms Registry had run grossly above original cost estimates. Taxpayers were originally expected to pay only $2 million of the budget while registration fees would cover the rest. The final tally to implement the ineffective CFP program was 2 billion dollars and 44 million dollars a year to administer. The program is a failure and the Liberals still want to keep it."CommentKey:1c8fa874-0bc4-4020-bafe-636fe7b5760e	2000415568	Sat Feb 12 2011 11:43:47 GMT-0500 (EST)	Vox Populi Z	23	"The Liberals’ social re-engineering ideology have ruined this great country and created an ineffective, expensive and dangerous 'nanny state' that has undermined our civil liberties and inalienable rights.   History shows that as a government grows, liberty decreases. Government does not grow by overtly seizing our freedoms, but by incrementally assuming our responsibilities. Liberals want the government to be your mommy and feel they have a moral right to treat us like children. They want you to surrender your civil liberty in exchange for expensive and ineffective public policy that only serves to expand government bureaucracy, heighten government control and ultimately raise taxes. They typically dupe trusting Canadians by opportunistically sensationalizing ‘Henny Penny’ stories about the ‘Sky falling’ and creating misguided public policy to over stated problems to project an illusion that they are actually doing something constructive – all to save us from ourselves.  Liberty means responsibility. That is why most citizens dread it and have voluntarily surrendered it to the government. The government is not omnipotent, is not omnipresent, and it cannot be everywhere and be everything to everybody. Your life is your responsibility and not the states. Unfortunately, when faced with the pain of such freedom, many effete Canadian citizens of today recoil from the responsibility of liberty and beg for their government shackles. Do not trade your liberty for security for you shall have neither.

None of these factors appear with the Harper administration. Their stability as a minority government is also enhanced by what many voters see as a weak and vacillating opposition in the form of Iggy and certainly a lack of hope in Layton, Ducepe and May.   As much as I fear what will happen to my Canada should Harper ever achieve a majority government, I  understand  that Canadians will accept the status quo with Harper rather than risk the potential turmoil that will result with the Liberals in power under Iggy and his seeming invisibility and vacillating on issues of national significance  Iggy has not set Canadians on fire and if the Liberals ever want to form a government again - even a minority - unfortunately they will need a leader that presents a more formidable personality than  Iggy.

What worries me about Wall is how he would deal with the hodgebodge of geniuses and ignoramuses in the Con Party today.  Do you actually think if we had a better opposition the Conservative Defence Minister would have gotten away with failing 3rd grade geography the way Peter MacKay did when he suggested that BC and California share a border.  I know he was confusing the continental plate there, but still?  He forgot about Oregon and Washington!!! That would be acceptable from some lowly minister, but the minister of defence?

Examples:  1) A concerted ""tough on crime"" approach that will cost billions without improving public safety, despite the fact that even many American conservatives who previously supported such an appproach admit is a dismal failure. Furthermore, when confronted with data showing crime is actually decreasing in Canada, the conservatives counter with the bizarre and unsubstantiated claim that ""unreported crime"" is up.  2) Attempts to shut down Vancouver's legal injection drug site and other harm reduction strategies, despite the insistence by medical experts that such programs save lives and do not increase drug use. (As an emergency physician at an inner city hospital I can speak with some authority on this issue.)  3) A refusal to fund any foreign aid programs that fund abortion (despite te fact that in many parts of the world preganancy due to rape is a frequent occerrence and women denied access to safe abortion services resort to dangerous illegal abortions). It should also be noted that the initial strategy was to not fund birth control programs, although the Conservatives quickly backpedalled on this issue.  4) An abrupt change in Canada's policy of requesting clemency for Canadians seeking the death penalty in other countries (most notably the United States).

Incidences in the  past couple of years in particular have had the majority of Canadians howling for changes to the way our immigration and refugee system is set up and the outrageous costs involved due to our open door policy.  Canadians are tired of bearing the costs of twenty years of appeals which challenge deportation orders, the endless Human Rights complaints about accomodating every minorities wishes, the release and acceptance of questionable asylum seekers, the housing, language training, welfare, health care costs etc., while at the same time studies show that massive immigration is not improving the economy and is causing a divide amongst Canadian citizens.  This is becoming a HUGE election issue and one only has to follow the blogs and polls to see that a lot of die hard lefties have stated they would vote right ( even if just this one time)  if it meant better control of this one issue alone.   Harper is the only one so far that is trying to make the changes that Canadians are demanding on the immigration issue and he will gain a lot of support because of that.  Although it's only one issue, it could be the one that wins Harper the next election, especially if he were to decrease the intake of immigrants for a while which is the one thing he has NOT done. If he did that he would have the next election in the bag.  Too many Canadians are unemployed and all Canadians are very heavily taxed and simply cannot afford any more.  Too many seniors are living in poverty and they make up a Huge block of Canadian voters.   Immigration reform will be one of the major issues in the next election."CommentKey:2c2b817c-e2e9-442a-b97a-9fd0603ef899	2000415568	Sat Feb 12 2011 13:08:04 GMT-0500 (EST)	MrBay77	0	"I will pick a Party,but not the sameold,same old.The only Federal Government with avery good name,veryhonest,and truthful.I`ll add even the best nick name.`The Chief,If there was  such,Pick someone with that Title."CommentKey:9f750ce9-dc98-424a-9d26-1765b265a020	2000415568	Sat Feb 12 2011 13:08:13 GMT-0500 (EST)	dgordon	6	"Canadians, especially Toronto, and Montreal need to listen to the pulse of the country and realize that the old elites no longer hold sway and the common mans opinions are now being recognized.

We all watched it happen on TV,  it might not have been the kind of adds you are seeing from both political spectrums today, but it was the same thing, ""descending to this lowest form of persuasion"".  Again we all watched the same sort of negativism from the Liberals with their adds about the F35s or corporate taxes, when not too long ago the liberals were supporting them.    Their adds not quit as biting as the Conservative adds and not as much variety.  The former will change while the latter might not.  There biggest bitch is they can't financially keep up with the grass root conservatives, for mom and pop donations that has made the conservatives a bit more financially sound and can afford the TV Advertising time.  If the liberals had that kind of cash - well we would see wouldn't we.  The person made some absolute valid points about the conservatives but all three parties are forged by the influence of the others and not least of, the media itself.  Has it gotten more nasty, I don't think so, it is just more ""in your face"".  The media has changed since our Parents time and we know that the current speed at which information now flows to the public (witness Egypt, wow!) is at the very least, breathtaking.  Evolution is ongoing with this technology."CommentKey:3e232bea-1682-4fac-b6cc-2b13a64424e5	2000415568	Sat Feb 12 2011 13:44:58 GMT-0500 (EST)	LarryRight	11	"McWal_Job wrote:Posted 2011/02/12 at 1:02 PM ETThis is Harper's last stand.

I am disabled and I support myself on my own private pension and will just this year get my Canada pension benefits. I have made the investment in solar to make my income be stable for the next 20 years and while my wife works, she will retire in two more years. That make us very much then needing to get all of our benefits that have been promised to us a necessity. I do not trust the liberals to ever be able to look out after those like me who did work to get here and qualify . They are more suited to the people who just arrive and making sure that welfare is there for those who are not even citizens. I pay for my dental and healtcare extras but if I were on welfare I would get the top notch treatment at no cost. That is the liberal way of thinking and if I lost all my pride I could do that. But I would have to sell all I own and hide the money. and to me that is cheating. Again that sounds like the liberal way.   I look at Iggy and wonder at just how this person could have ever got the support to make him leader. Then I remember that the party was so badly damaged about its corruption thta the back room guys called on Dion to save face and take the helm. He was the most incompetent leade ever so and energency came to pass and they then oput Iggy in as leader. He has never lead in anything . He ws a teacher , and teachers never do anyting new they just try and report the past events with talking points added to help others understand what happened.

He has repeatedly shown his contempt for democratic discourse by using a highly centralized information warfare strategy to control all communication with the Canadian public, so he clearly views most Canadians as potential enemies (PR types refer to it as ""perception management""). He throws twenty plus billion dollars away on the unproven as of yet unflyable F-35s, all without any public tender or transparency. He is trying to push through all manner of anti-crime legislation to fill the prisons he wants to build (he is already advertising for inmates with advertisements for victims hotlines). We would certainly expect social support spending to be slashed which will help fill the streets with homeless and fill his prisons as well, well much of the public will cower in fear of his ever expanding and ever more intrusive police powers (all done in the name of public safety of course). Libertarian types who buy his less government nonsense should really look critically at the intrusiveness of his agenda. What we will have is more government but less accountability because everything is controlled through the Prime Minister's Office. It is a shame the Liberals are in such a shambles under the inept leaderships of Ignatieff. With poll numbers like this Harper will push his anti-democratic agenda even harder. Let everyone with any hope for a democratic future in this country hope he fails."CommentKey:f9cd2f80-a390-41d1-9d3a-1f6c94cce078	2000415568	Sat Feb 12 2011 13:54:40 GMT-0500 (EST)	Alan_away 	9	"widman wrote:""Without even looking I can bet there are all sorts of pro-Con supporters here saying 37% means an imminent Majority, and thus, yet again, demonstrating the CON math deficiency!

Anyone who has ever read a widman post knows that yet another poll showing the CPC maintaining or increasing its lead over the LPC has just GOT to irritate the hell out of widman who can only transfuse that frustration by ""yet again"" insulting Conservative supporters.   For example widman claims that ""saying 37% means an imminent Majority"" demonstrates ""the CON math deficiency"" when historically in Canada there have been several majority governments that have only had between 35 to 40% of the popular vote while very rarely has any majority government taken a 51% or higher of the popular vote.   This just shows that widman confuses popular voting or polling preferences with how governments in Canada are actually formed as in ""And once again, as every poll in the past five years has demonstrated, the overwhelming Majority of Canadians are not behind the current regime and will not be voting for them."" So what, widman? As others have pointed out, the majority of Canadians are even more against having the LPC or NDP form a government on their own.   Yet widman persists in dreaming somehow a coalition of the LPC and NDP would be triumphant as in ""An election today would yield the same result, only this time the opposition will be prepared, and will present the GG with a plan for governing that represents the Majority."" Really? Sorry, that was tried after the last election but Ignatieff, who supported it then, says no to it now.

What is seeming to be a perpetual minority government of the Conservatives, and a fractured opposition.  I honestly don't think this will change, one way or the other.  It pretty much reflects the times we live in and any party that manages to capture the minority government can give thanks to our current 'first past the post' voting system.  I'm hoping that the reality of the vote will reflect something quite a bit different than current polls.  That wouldn't be the first time something like that had occurred.  And a coalition is something that I'm beginning to consider as just the vehicle to have representation of the majority of voting Canadians.  But I'm not so certain that these poles aren't the truest reflection of just how fractured our country is and a reflection of the self-interest that has absorbed the country.  Fearful times will do that.  At least in the new millennium.  I honestly wouldn't mind the Conservatives capturing another minority if only that would lead to a re-evaluation of Harper as their leader.  I'm not so against Conservative policy as the policy of Harper; that Reform-Conservative dogma is 'the' issue for them not getting a majority.  The word is that the old guard Conservatives loathe him and would like nothing better than to have him replaced.  Both to rid the party of him, and to put themselves in a better position to appeal to more voters to get that majority rule."CommentKey:2f4124ae-b850-4f02-8015-dd1d1c762dd9	2000415568	Sat Feb 12 2011 13:57:05 GMT-0500 (EST)	astrazeneca	6	Canadians and immigrants are sick of the NANNY STATE!CommentKey:db8b7d17-5610-421e-b802-eb5fc7228eef	2000415568	Sat Feb 12 2011 13:58:25 GMT-0500 (EST)	oldgreg	1	"dougthebox wrote:Posted 2011/02/12 at 12:59 PM ET  1) A concerted ""tough on crime"" approach that will cost billions without improving public safety, despite the fact that even many American conservatives who previously supported such an appproach admit is a dismal failure.

To discover this, you have to read the EKOS report (linked to this story) all the way to the end, which most people don't bother to do.  When the polling method changes, the outcome is likely to change. While we can't know for sure that this accounts for the apparent surge in Conservative fortunes, it may do.  I think the new method may be more accurate than the previous, and so I don't think this change is reason for Liberals to cheer, but it may explain why there is currently so much variation from polling company to polling company.  It will be interesting to see whether the next EKOS poll is more in line with what other companies are reporting: Conservative support at about 35%.  If so, then the next EKOS poll may report a drop in Conservative support, and the partisan Liberals will claim it is real rather than statistical error.  It does seem that Conservative support is trickling upwards this year, and that Liberal support is stagnant. I think this is not due to good government policies and good subsequent socio-economic outcomes, but to weak opposition putting forward no new alternatives."CommentKey:02b999eb-9d95-4911-a8b6-ee57b3b23712	2000415568	Sat Feb 12 2011 14:26:02 GMT-0500 (EST)	MaryClarke	10	"skye60 wrote: ""I'm a senior on a pathetic CPP and I have my income controlled by the inflation rate"" ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I'm not meaning to sound unsympathic,but surely you didn't expect to live out your retiremnt soley on your CPP,did you??

Of course 37.3% makes them the most popular of Canada's unpopular political parties (since none have support from a majority of Canadians).  Now when you look at what kind of politics Canadians like only 37.3% (represented by Cons. voters) support right wing politics.  While 62.7% (represented by Lib., NDP, Green and Bloc. voters) support centre-left politics.  So while Canadian who like right wing politics have only one party to vote for, Canadians who like centre-left politics have 3 parties to split their votes among (4 for those in Quebec).  If the right was ever to split (come one Wild Rose Party) then Canada would very likely have a minority centre-left government.    Don't expect any majority governments until one of the political parties seriously cleans up its act (or gets really amazing PR)."CommentKey:f4c2cde5-d071-4eb1-9ca3-0649b97b384b	2000415568	Sat Feb 12 2011 14:50:34 GMT-0500 (EST)	PeterDN	13	"hangman wrote:Posted 2011/02/12 at 2:13 PM ET ""Heres an idea, if Harper doesn't want an election ,then listen to the Opposition and scrap the gifts for corporations, and cancel the sole sourced fighter jets and do things properly and reinstate the mandatory long form census ...

Took 1.5 hours to get through the customs line. Every 10th or so person or family was ""escorted"" to another area. Asked the Customs/Immigration Agent what it was all about, and I was told that they were the refugee claimants who suddenly had no papers.

They don't tell the public their bills will not work anyway. The bamboozle them into thinking they actually are doing something when in reality it is more of the same old same old.

From the Globe: The passage of long-needed refugee reform legislation, now imminent, has required too many contortions on Parliament Hill. But the Conservatives, Bloc Québécois and NDP are to be commended for working together and getting a deal done, while the Liberals should wonder what their last-minute intransigence gained for them, or for the greater benefit of a more streamlined refugee system.  The need for reform was never in doubt. Refugee claims take too long to process, making the transition to Canada for genuine refugees more difficult than it ought to be, while dubious claimants can access a seemingly endless appeals process to stay in Canada for years. The legislation tabled in March by Jason Kenney, the Immigration Minister, created a better system in both regards.  Last week members of the Liberal Party caucus revolted against the bill, despite compromises arranged between Mr. Kenney and their own immigration critic, Maurizio Bevilacqua.  But good sense won the day. The Conservatives, who could have toughened their stance or made political hay of the Liberals' tactics, looked for other legislative partners. The NDP and Bloc played a constructive role, agreeing that reform was needed and gaining changes important to their supporters.  Ignatieff also firmly believes that daggers should be allowed in Parliament,once again pandering for the Minority vote."CommentKey:430a0230-29aa-4d06-a226-dfbe7e98e584	2000415568	Sat Feb 12 2011 16:14:08 GMT-0500 (EST)	Handiman	4	lots of reasons not to vote CONS only one not to Fiberal they're Liberals---both parties stinkCommentKey:8c179a62-54ab-4242-b350-92b0cd5a54c4	2000415568	Sat Feb 12 2011 16:15:26 GMT-0500 (EST)	Denis 	6	"Get rid of Ignatieffe & the Libs will make the Cons disappear!

You don't become sucessfull in life my being a ""stupid gun-toting hillbilly"".

Books and information regarding how our parliamentary system works are readily available on the net and at your local library. Intro to political science courses are available at your local community college. I suggest you follow up on them because there is nothing in our laws or traditions that requires any party, or group of parties, to announce coalition plans ahead of an election. Coalitions normally come about as the result of an election, not as something predetermined going into an election! All parties go into elections to win them. When there is no clear winner (meaning one party earns a clear majority) then coalitions come into play. When no party achieves a clear majority, then there are no clear winners. It is up to the parties, after the election, to decide for themselves if they can put together a coalition.  Also, the GG would not base his decision on which party had the most votes,  unless that party on its own held a majority of the seats. The GG's only question would be: Do the parties proposing a coalition collectively hold enough seats to form a stable govt?"CommentKey:79f662f1-261c-47d6-b3ce-711b33e15f8f	2000415568	Sat Feb 12 2011 16:39:59 GMT-0500 (EST)	canadaawakening	6	"Clearly, the Liberals have had their chance in government, and have blown it big time.

While it can be said that the Conservatives are full of hot-air as well, but at least they actually have gotten things accomplished, and done so under a minority government (The longest running one in Canadian history if I'm not mistaken)    The reality of the situation is this:  While the Conservatives have a minority, none of the opposition offers anything of substance.  The combined opposition could force elections whenever they damn well wanted, but to do so would only result the same election results anyways.

People are tired of the usual Liberal tactics of pandering for votes,rather than doing what's best for the Country.. From the Globe: The passage of long-needed refugee reform legislation, now imminent, has required too many contortions on Parliament Hill. But the Conservatives, Bloc Québécois and NDP are to be commended for working together and getting a deal done, while the Liberals should wonder what their last-minute intransigence gained for them, or for the greater benefit of a more streamlined refugee system.  The need for reform was never in doubt. Refugee claims take too long to process, making the transition to Canada for genuine refugees more difficult than it ought to be, while dubious claimants can access a seemingly endless appeals process to stay in Canada for years. The legislation tabled in March by Jason Kenney, the Immigration Minister, created a better system in both regards.  Last week members of the Liberal Party caucus revolted against the bill, despite compromises arranged between Mr. Kenney and their own immigration critic, Maurizio Bevilacqua.  But good sense won the day. The Conservatives, who could have toughened their stance or made political hay of the Liberals' tactics, looked for other legislative partners. The NDP and Bloc played a constructive role, agreeing that reform was needed and gaining changes important to their supporters.  And now Ignatieff firmly believes that daggers should be allowed in Parliament,once again pandering for the Minority vote at the expense of the Country. In it for themselves. Harper was right."CommentKey:dff745eb-d49e-422b-b500-9bb5933c2de9	2000415568	Sat Feb 12 2011 16:57:00 GMT-0500 (EST)	oldgreg	8	"roddyinwaterloo wrote:Posted 2011/02/12 at 3:41 PM ET  here is some good news that cbc don't feel like reporting......  OTTAWA — Canada’s international trade balance swung to a surprise surplus in December, as energy-driven exports grew at pace not seen in 29 years.  Statistics Canada said Friday that exports rose 9.7% — the largest percentage gain in 29 years —to $37.8-billion during the month, while imports edged up 0.7% to $34.8-billion.  That resulted in a trade surplus of $3-billion — the highest level since October 2008, just ahead of the recession ============  You forgot a few important details there roddy;  Energy products exports rose 25.1 per cent  with volumes accounting for almost two-thirds of the increase.  Sharp price increases were also a large factor.  Much of the rest was due to other resource based increases and increases in commodity prices.  Another factor was that imports remained largely flat.   More telling of the health of the entire economy is this;  ""Canadian manufactured goods have had a tough time competing on the international scale, and Canada’s share of world exports has been cut in half over the last decade.""   Much of this is a result of the Harper governments high dollar policy which favors the resource industries, and you guessed it, Western Canada.

The left has 60% or more of the vote scattered among 4 parties...  ...and I love it. Eventually, barring a merger on the left, all these parties are going to have to accept that our country will be governed by a CPC or, less likely, a Liberal minority, and begin cooperating on policy. Cooperation produces better policy and corruption than majority dictatorship - the CPP and medicare versus Adscam and Air India, for instance - and cooperation soothes the ridiculous partisanship most people on these forums waste their time on. I'd personally prefer we did away with political parties - so that, you know, our MPs could offer their actual opinion without getting kicked out of their party and basically barred from public life - but I'll settle for perma-minority gladly!  I believe Harper is capable of running a minority, if he'd give up on majority-hunting and Quebec-vote-buying. The stimulus was the right decision, and was forced on him by the opposition. He's done a good job on the rarely-spoken-of problem of zero-competition in the cellular industry, and he's always reacted decisively and swiftly to foreign catastrophes like Haiti.  However, ironically enough, he's only likely to get a majority by becoming more liberal, and its probably already dead. Every attack on the Liberals, NDP, and Bloc crush that dream a little further. Every prison and airplane bone he tossed to his base push the center-left - still the majority in this country - away.  My prediction for the next election? A Conservative minority.

As far as being ""bad for the economy"", that couldn't be further from the truth. Tax cuts for corporations stimulates growth. So does free trade. Harper supports both, among other things, and I support him for that.

So putting together the facts that the jobs have returned to the economy (unlike in the US and most other industrialized first world countries) and the previously approved tax cuts for corporations, is it unreasonable to assume that business may stop increasing payrolls in Canada as a result of IGGY's vote getting strategy?

People are tired of the usual Liberal tactics of pandering for votes,rather than doing what's best for the Country..  From the Globe:  The passage of long-needed refugee reform legislation, now imminent, has required too many contortions on Parliament Hill. But the Conservatives, Bloc Québécois and NDP are to be commended for working together and getting a deal done, while the Liberals should wonder what their last-minute intransigence gained for them, or for the greater benefit of a more streamlined refugee system.   The need for reform was never in doubt. Refugee claims take too long to process, making the transition to Canada for genuine refugees more difficult than it ought to be, while dubious claimants can access a seemingly endless appeals process to stay in Canada for years. The legislation tabled in March by Jason Kenney, the Immigration Minister, created a better system in both regards.   Last week members of the Liberal Party caucus revolted against the bill, despite compromises arranged between Mr. Kenney and their own immigration critic, Maurizio Bevilacqua.   But good sense won the day. The Conservatives, who could have toughened their stance or made political hay of the Liberals' tactics, looked for other legislative partners.

The economic growth resulted from a reformed banking system and deep tax cuts. The government initially enacted a flat corporate tax of 9% and a flat personal income tax of 15%, which this year was also reduced to 9%.    Despite these substantial tax cuts, the national budget went into surplus and national debt was reduced from 88 percent of GDP in 2002 to 36 percent of GDP in 2006.  Real GDP growth measured in 2006 was 6.5 percent.  Inflation has been at or below 3 percent.    Oh, yeah - unemployment was also halved in four years (2002 to 2006) from 30% to 14.7 percent.   Montenegro has seen the highest per capita rate of foreign investment in Europe.  Not bad for a country that emerged from the Yugoslavian Wars not long ago!  But then, I think they already understood that the socialist, big government model, in all its variations, doesn't work and so they wasted no time on it.

Also, without confusing you too much, there is no way to confirm that those revenues would have existed if the taxes hadn't been cut since higher taxes only leads to less spending.   Afghanistan was budgetted through 2009 and 2010 (and supported by the Liberals) and was accounted for before the recession hit. It was also the right thing to do.   Security for G20 ended up costing around 900 million. Hardly makes up the 56 billion 2009 shortfall you keep harping about.   The PMO office expansion and the ad campaigns is pittance.

They are doing everything in their power to destroy everything that the previous governments have given the citizens in over 100 years because of THEIR ideology!  Will the Canadians who never look at the news or never vote realize what they are doing to Canada and turn against then as they have done in Egypt or do they care as much about their country as the Egyptians do??"				CommentKey:d677d7bc-34cb-438f-a6ee-6fb38270b58f	2000415568	Sat Feb 12 2011 22:15:39 GMT-0500 (EST)	dgordon	2	"johnrod wrote: Only a true Harper-Con would consider cutting poor people off welfare a game.
