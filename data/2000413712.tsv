The NHL is a prime example of players running (ruining?) the league.

I dont blame the playerrs of the nhl saying that he is the least liked coach that they would want to play for... If you look at his past success the past few years his team and their reputation has gone down the toilet. He is a good man but just not a coach fit for the job of coaching a team like the maple leafs. He is not strong willed enough and he constantly has problems withe the media and his own players. If he wants to keep his job and get players to start liking him he needs to make some major changes in the way he coaches and his attitude. The maple leafs have not made the playoffs for many years since the sundin days and i dont think they will be getting anywhere close for another few years too. They have some serious issues regaurding goaltending, offensive scoring, coaching, etc. I love don cherry but he makes some really stupid moves sometimes. Im not saying standing up for ron is bad but if you think about it, it just makes ron look more like a bad coach. I liked ron wilson back when he coached san jose. At least there he was liked and had some success.

The Leafs have a losing history, the fans and media scrutinize your every move off and on the ice.  If you can make the same kind of money, playing for a team that wants to win in another city, of course you are going to ignore Toronto, why put yourself through that pain.

Simply put, as long as you dress 20 players, the ACC will be sold out at ridiculous ticket prices.  Even if you are missing 1 player, the Marlies are down the Gardiner to send someone to fill the spot.  The fact that Kessel an over rated player got picked last in the All-Star game, says enough of the Leafs team.    Unfortunately, in my 30+ years of life, I was born raised and remain a Leafs fan.  SOME DAY in my life time I hope to see the Stanley Cup down Yonge St.  I still think next year a playoff visit will occur with an early exit.

I have been a leaf fan forever but they don't know what they are doing in their own end.    The other teams point men could have a coffee and a sandwich before deciding what to do with the puck in the Leaf's end of the rink. The leafs are always all gathered around screening their goalie. Most of the time they are 15 to 20 feet from him.    I have never seen a team give the other teams defenceman that kind of time to shoot or pass the puck.    All other teams are on the Leaf's defenceman right away in the other end of the rink. This has been going on with them for years.  Tired Leaf fan.

Maybe no one wants to move to Rob Ford country Don. If players want to live and play in Canada there are two excellent options known as Montreal and Vancouver. The players don't lie and their opinion is most important to this reader. Yes Don, much more than your recent drivel.

This guy is all about himself and in my opinion he's a Goof.  As far as Wilson goes he doesn't have a team to work with and as far as Toronto goes, as long as they continue to sell out with a bunch of losers nothing positive will happen to this franchise.  That is another reason why there should be a team in Hamilton, it's a no brainer but as long as the little guy Bettman is connected at the knee to these owners & shareholders it won't happen.  It's a joke and irresponsible for the NHL to deny Canadian hockey fans this right but of course that's the way this NHL is being run these days and they wonder why this league is in such trouble these days.  The fans in Ontario certainly deserve better that's for sure.  Fran

Altho, he could look in the mirror and get the meaning that way.  Don is not only yesterday's man, but a 1940's man. A minor league mind with a minor league playing resume. He couldn't even win the Stanley Cup with a stacked team.

They have underachieving veterans and the problems there are just pressure from the spotlight related.  You can't coach a person out of stagefright. Komisarek is a good example of a guy with white-knuckles clenching his stick every shift. He's so worried about making a mistake and looking bad under the microscope that he can't even do the fundamentals some nights.  Overall this is a pretty well developing team. A lot of progress has already been made with this young roster. There is more work to do but you can't say that Wilson isn't trying.  In a market that expects to see a Stanley Cup every single season, and see it in every trade and every draft pick, you can understand the frustration. But the frustration is self-imposed by spectacularly high expectations.  And to rudyher who posted that the profits are what prevents the Leafs from winning...  *sigh*  Care to explain why Florida, Atlanta, New York (Isles), Columbus, St. Louis etc all do SOOOOO WELL with empty stadiums and bankrupt owners??  It's not a precedent for anything. Ownership has relatively nothing to do with the club's success or failure. They're essentially just entities that exist outside the actual game and are very irrelevant in terms of the actual team.

He is pure entertainment for those who like him. I think he is a loud-mouthed red neck who has lost touch with a game he use to know something about. The players don't like Ron Wilson because he doesn't understand when you should pat somebody on the back or when you should single them out for bad play. The example last week on Sportsnet really showed that. Nazem Kadri had been playing fairly well at the beginning of the season, doing most things right, but Wilson went on TV and emphasized some of his mistakes instead of complimenting the kid for doing the things right that he was doing. That is the sign of a bad coach. You don't emphasize an individual's bad play on National TV. That belongs in the locker room. Embarrassing players will only make them resent you as a coach - hence the voting.

No team in the league has the same pressure and media madness surrounding it then Toronto. That and the curse.  It has only been until recently that the press have been anything but lapdogs for the Leafs. The pressure of playing in Montreal with the demands for greatness gone bye and the only game in town is far far worse. Yet the organization weathers it and players still want to play there.

And if you disagree with him being a bigot, just look at how he's spoken out against P.K. Subban."  You and many others don't seem to really be listening to what Cherry is actually saying.  He knows that no NHL veteran is going to accept disrespect from some wet-behind-the-ears rookie who hasn't proved himself yet.  He knows that sooner or later someone is going to call the rookie on it, maybe in a violent way.  If he likes the rookie, he gives him some warning before it's too late.  He did the same thing for Crosbie, and took a lot of heat for that, too.  He likes Crosbie, and he likes Subban, or he wouldn't have bothered trying to straighten either of them out.  Same with Ovie and his earlier showboating.  For Cherry, playing by the unwritten code is everything.  If you consistently break the code, and he thinks you don't know any better, he will try to let you know what you're doing wrong.  If he thinks you are deliberately breaking the code, then yeah, he definitely won't like you.  If he sounded bigoted in the past, it was because players from other hockey cultures didn't abide by the code.  You don't hear much of that stuff from him today because the code has been spreading around to the other cultures, and at the very least, incoming players are more aware of how they need to adapt to the NHL.  So stop hearing what _you_ think Cherry is saying, and try listening to what _he_ actually says.

Toronto wants a winner...........  and the city has been more than just a little patient with the team over a period of decades, not just years.    The problem lies with the "Owners", not the team.  Change the owners, and everything else will fall into place.  It’s like changing the Queen Bee in a hive.  Unfortunately, the 'worker bees' in this case have little power over who sets the agenda!  If you could not stomach them from kindergarten through high school, there's not much chance you could work for them either.  A wholesale change at the top is the only way Toronto will ever see another Stanley Cup.

Especially if the team has a lot of rebuilding to do and a lot of pressure to deal with. Also every coach has a different strategy to help their team excel. So, I agree for Don Cherry to stand up for Ron Wilson because he has coached before and knows about the pressures of running a hockey team.

What he is saying is that there should never be a poll such as the one taken among players.If i were an owner and a player from my team answered that type of poll, he would find himself so deep in tne minors a GPS wouldn help him find his way back. This is definatly a case where the weasel (bettman) should get involved in. Deny the press from asking that type of question. And I hate the laffs but have to stick up for the team on this

People don't want to play in Toronto because they're a bad team that's being mismanaged.  Players all around the NHL know that the Leafs are "earning" a high-ranking 1st round draft pick this year, but won't get one, just like they didn't get the 2nd overall pick they earned last year.    The Leafs are losing, and are getting no helping hand from the draft in return for their consistent losing.  Who wants to play for a team with no hopes or prospects for the future?

As for players not wanting to play here - well duh. Where did the Devils place in that poll? One of the very best organizations in hockey, and I bet no one wants to play there right now. Toronto can be a fantastic place to play, and the fans will respect you if you leave it all on the ice. Look at Gilmour, Clark, Joseph, Belfour, Sittler, Tiger and a lot of others - all of them local heroes in a different way than any other place. All of this noise is a result of almost 6 years of no playoffs - nothing else..

More 'center of the universe' thinking out of TO.  Players in every league have pressure on them - it's just that the pressure gets more intense the more your team sucks!

Unfortunately for the Leaf fans, their team is currently one of the bottom feeders and so no player of any real talent wants to go there. When Burke finally manages to right the ship, some Ontario boys may want to return home but don't hold your breath on the others. Canada's team is now alive and well and living in Vancouver and there is still time to get on the bandwagon. We are all Canucks!

Ultimately, professional sports like anything else is about making money, and apparently the Leafs are able to make money and lose at the same time.  If you want them to improve, stop buying tickets and they will be forced to make changes to bring back the fans. I really don't care because I hate the leafs, but there it is. As for Don Cherry, sure he don't know it all, but he definitely has a point. Coaching a team is sure to be difficult enough, even on a team that is actually good, but throwing him under the bus with a survey of that kind certainly wouldn't inspire confidence and wont aid the leafs in there current predicament.

He will support Stephen Harper next to keep the collection going.  Don Cherry's bombast used to be entertaining but his schtick is well past its best before date.

Don Cherry never won a Stanley Cup as a coach...even with arguably the greatest player ever on his team (Bobby Orr)...  Don Cherry coached a game where he blew a 6-0 lead, against the Canadians, IN THE THIRD PERIOD, allowing Montreal to eventually clinch the Stanley Cup.  What success does he have in the NHL in order to be elevated to an expert in coaching, or having a show called "Coaches Corner"?  Is he Scotty Bowman? Glen Sather? Al Arbour? Fred Shero? Mike Babcock?  Gimme a break.....he is a relic of an old age in the NHL where the "boy's club" got things served to them without merit.....which seems to be going away the last 10-15 years thankfully, and making the NHL relevant again.

The reality is that Burke and Wilson’s roles have been reversed.  Burke, as manager should make decisions that are ruthless and without regard for the players feelings. His only goal should be to win. The bottom line! On the other hand, Wilson should be getting the best out of every player. He cannot achieve that with loose lips, antagonism and negativity. The recent poll says it all. If the top six lines in the NHL were to join the Leafs, they would win the first few games and then the Wilson effect  would screw up their heads.

Relevant again? Spoken like a true blue, pre-pubescent child who was still just Daddy's little squirt and a tear in his eye 10-15 years ago.  "Old age" hockey, as you call it, was infinitely more exciting than the watered down, Amuricanized NHL of today. Of course, you'd have to be old enough to know this to be true.

Next thing you'll be bleating is that the game is just "too rough" and needs less testosterone and more estrogine.

Every time they lose it's always somebody ease's fault. They whine if the announcers don't praise their team the way they think they should be praised. They whine about Cherry because he tells it like it is.  If he sees something he doesn't like, he say it, no matter which team it is. Hab and Canuck fans are so fragile that they can't handle that.  It's called insecurity.  I don't always agree with everything Cherry says either.  But i'm smart enough to know that he knows more about hockey than every single poster on this site.

He's a coach of a horrible team and is arrogant, pushy, mean and bitter in public.  He called a reporter a swear word for asking about the booing fans and then walked out of a press conference.  Because apparently the fans and reporters should take his feelings into consideration before disapproving of yet another failure of a year under his direction.    Let's see, a coach who has never won anything despite heading some great teams in SJ and the Olympics, is rude and abrasive and the players hate him.  You can retire now Cherry!  We've found your replacement!

He actually believes the crap he spews. don is a washed up old fart who sees himself differently than most. His comments on hockey night in canada are getting 'old and outdated',  and its time for him to hang up his tack. Ron ought to go with him. Two dip's together, flying  off into the sunset. Why can't CBC get some real commentators like TSN, or Sportsnet, media types who are smart and show it,withoug putting people down, whether its other players or an enemy of 'big brother' and his odd couple buddy, Harper, he has run his course.

However, you have to give Cherry credit for sticking up for the Canadian Forces, as well as being pro-Canadian at all times (maybe this is a carry over from being in the US for a while).  As a coach, I can understand the pressure coaches are under...keep in mind, Wilson didn't pick his team, he did however have some input.  Maybe the CBC should have had a questionaire on Management & Owners too.  But then again, the CBC does have the right to put pressure where pressure is due -- they are in the news business afterall.  It is that pressure that pro coaches should expect--proportional to their pay?

Those taking the poll probably think that it is their job to do so, just as Cherry thinks it is his to take shots at Wilson, part of his role in being a hockey analyst, although many wish he could be more tactful doing so, a bit of a case of being holier than thou.

It should be the players who get fired for not doing their job.  But......in this case what I see is a team of talented young players waiting for their opportunity to bust out ........ being coached by a grumpy old man who shows little respect for the players in the public eye.  Wilson does not have the respect of the majority of the players on the team and this is one instance where I would agree that firing the coach may be the right move to make. Not to say there aren't a couple of players that shouldn't be fired too, but something surely has to happen to shake things up.  I wouldn't want to play for Wilson either.  That said.......  GO LEAFS GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Let us look at the poll that was done by the players last year. The players were asked who they thought was the Most Overrated Player in the league. The answer...Roberto Luongo. One which doesn't really surprise me.  Now, back to today. This poll says that Roberto Luongo is the hardest goalie to score on. Well...what I find rather amusing about this is that if you look at the shootout records of the goalies this year, he has a .444 save percentage. That is a rather embarrassing statistic in my opinion.   Next...

In the story I read Don Cherry is critical of the CBC doing a poll to find out who the NHL players like least as a coach; Mr Cherry doesn't think that type of poll should be done.....Don Cherry at least in the article above which I've read doesn't say whether he agrees or disagrees with the Ron Wilson selection as the coach you wouldn't like to play for.....If anyone could be seen as standing up for Ron Wilson in this article it's the CBC.

They're overly emotional about their favorite team, but have little or no real knowledge or experience at the game.    Anyone who criticizes their team must be bad and against them.   So they really can't be taken seriously.

He was saying that coaching is touch enough without popularity polls from the players. Ranking coaches as to see who is the nicest? Really? Who cares what the players think. They are paid to play hockey. I can't even believe someone has the right to complain about anything if they are getting to be paid to play the funnest game ever.  And sure Don is a bit of homer, always talking about TO even though they have not generated much excitement of late. He is a passionate guy.  And you can call Don all the names you like. Hockey players and coaches respect what he has to say. He is very knowledgeable. He watches more hockey per day than most of you do in a month. He has played at every level and coached in the NHL. He loves hockey and does not want it changed into shinny. Neither do I.

True Cherry is an entertainer, but he also has hockey knowledge, and lots of it. Regardless of what gets posted here,  both Cherry and McLean are hugely popular with Canadians.  In fact, Coach's Corner is the most popular Canadian television production in history.  If you remember a few years ago, Nancy Lee of CBC  sports tried to get rid of Coach's Corner by not renewing McLean's and Cherry's contract.  There was such an outcry from coast to coast by Canadian hockey fans that she had to reverse her stand and renew their contracts.

He did nothing in San Jose and has done even less in Toronto. He's like a player who doesn't know when to quit! His methods are outdated and he is not a nice guy. Be arrogant and an A-hole are okay if you're winning. He's not winning so its time for him to move on. Bottom line, the survey is accurate!

Some people find Cherry entertaining and that's fine, but even if he has something relevant to say about hockey (he's been out of the league for what now, 30 years? And never actually acheived anything while there), he's just one voice out of many.  Frankly, I'll take the opinions of current players over his any day of the week.  But to be honest I trust the opinion of a lampshade more than his.  Having said all that, I have to agree with him on the level that no good can come out of a question like the worst coach.

I'm sure off the record he can verify that.  It only makes sense because otherwise what player wouldn't want to come, and most, have had the opportunity at some point, to work in the centre of the self-annointed hockey universe.  Leaf fans try to make heros out of players with limited talent so you can imagine what would become of a player like Sid or Ovie in that atmosphere, but alas they see it is a losing proposition and have gone on to build real hockey markets among the knowledgeable fans of other cities.  Canad'a team as the fans like to say is an ongoing joke because of silly goings on there and the need to blindly support below par talent...oh look I said par, something the players with the Leafs have a better chance of acheiving than a playoff position.

Now, that time has past and Cherry  has become a parody of hisself blathering on topics which he has no knowledge and venturing into areas that  reveal his rednecked  ignorance.

Most likely again, they are not in the playoffs for 2011 season and Ron Wilson has to go, or be fired, like always, when a coach is not winning.

Since I got my PVR  I never watch Cherry's corner or any of the commercials associated with that intermission. I am in total agreement with the comments that he never did anything in Hockey, he was a buffon, mugger, dirty player, fighter, loudmouth, ignorant racist in his AHL carreer and on his Corner segment. In his NHL carreer he still must have dreams of Guy Lafleur and the chants of Guy, Guy, Guy ringing through his senile mind. He has become a broken record and a dinosaur who needs to be put to pasture.  Again CBC take note  .I am thanful I have a PVR and I never have to watch the Hotstove or its commercials associated with that segment because of Milbury, who appears to be the heir apparent to the Coach's corner. It makes sense one racist dinosaur for another.  I used to love the Hotstove portion of the show, but since Milbury was put on it and who is a dinosaur, a buffon and  a loudmouth  ignorant racist, I never watch the show any longer. The only thing I can remember about MIlbury is illogical loud senseless rants on the show. In the NHL? He is noted for going into the stands and beating a fan up with a shoe. He actually used the fan's shoe. What a Wacko, then and now. As GM? Forget about it (SEE NYI) ! !  CBC take note:  Cherr(idiot # 1) = Milbury(Idiot # 2) = Mistake = Bad for Business Get rid of Cherry and Milbury they are already past their due date.  You have a great start with LeBrun and Francis, they should be your focus not Idiot #1 and Idiot # 2.

Coaching is hard enough without getting polls like that, that's the way I [think]."   He's not even defending Wilson simply saying he doesn't agree with such a poll. All these ad hominem arguments are pointless. And no I'm not Leafs fan or a fan of Don Cherry really.

Why do we find it so hard to let people be what they are and not resent them for it?  Its why if you want to be a success you have to go to the US.  There is a joke about 2 pails of lobsters one is American lobsters and the others are Canadians.  Only the pail with American lobsters needs a lid on it since the Canadain lobsters pulls any lobster that is about to climb out back down.   We don't have to like or agree with anothers success just let them have it.

Given Cherry's oftentimes pointless rants and biased/slanted views on certain topics, however, I find it insulting that my taxes are paying this loudmouth's salary via the CBC.

He slanders Wilson every chance he gets and now defending him?  The reason why Wilson isn't liked is because he is a tool and the players have made it clear they don't like him.  This is common knowledge.  There will be NO relief in Toronto until Wilson and Burke are gone.  They accomplished nothing on the other respective teams they were involved in and TO fans are doomed to these two clowns.

They've been making far too much money on merchandise licensing and TV rights to care about the crappy product they've been putting out. Leafs fans need to stop buying the tickets and the jerseys and change the channel before the owners will notice, if they'll even notice then. Forty-three years is an awfully long free ride.

I do believe HNIC intermissions need an over haul with the exception of McLean, Lebrun and Stock. Francis, Milbury are too confrontational and not viewer friendly. Time for a shake up and Don should be the first to go. Coaches Corner had its day a long time ago time now for CBC to come with new ideas to keep us wanting to watch the intermissions...not like now, where the tv is flipped to another game.

I don't understand people not liking Cherry. He's a good person who cares about his country and his country's game. He says things that have truth in them, and I guess that bothers some. I don't agree with some of his views, but he does understand the game of hockey more than any of you. He is so nice when you meet him.

Beiing an American CBC viewer, and hockey tourist; it shocked me in seeing the difference between my experience at a Leafs preseason game, a Marlies regular season game, and a Blue Jays game.  Leafs preseason, almost $150 for a single seat with a disinterested crowd (they played the Habs, not the Thrashers).  Marlies, $40 bucks for a bad seat, maybe 900 fans in the seats.  A kid from LA had three goals, never saw him dress for the Leafs (but I did get a blue puck). Blue Jays - Tigers : about 14,000 fans for an April game, the guy next to me knew and was happy to talk baseball, and I got a seat in home run territory for about $25.  The Jays still send me offers on tickets and hotels, and it's been a few years.  Bottom line, the coach is a symptom.  Your problem is the brain trust that's running the show.

MLSE is owned by the Ontario Teacher's Pension Fund. Are you in anyway capable of drawing a connection between Ontario and Canada? Can name any provinces with more than 35% of the country's population?  Please tell us exactly how the owners have hurt the team's "play for years".

Any coach who would say, "the turning point in the game was the opening face-off" is a jerk and doesn't deserve to be a coach.   Maybe the losing streak the Leafs continually suffer (while being the winningest franchise in the NHL . . . go figure) is because of his verbal abuse and he creates low morale in the process.   Don Cherry supporting Wilson is perfect. It's good that these people find each other. Too bad they didn't have their own pay per view network so the rest of us don't have to listen to them.   Good bye Ron Wilson, anytime is a good time as far as I'm concerned.
