Happily it's the Canadian way to let elections change our leaders. That way our army can do their real job, because our democratic processes do theirs'.

Hopefully the Military will do what they are promising.  Now the rest of the world still needs to support Egypt in moving to a democratic society.  Egypt this year maybe China in 2014?

Looks like the military is well on its way to leading this country into democracy!   Like i said in an earlier post - from the frying pan, into the fire.

I may be a bit slow, but isn’t this called a Military Coup?  It may have been done in response to protests or the protests could have been conveniently timed, but the military taking over a government is rarely good news for citizens.  They are banning "meetings by labour unions or professional syndicates" (i.e. public meetings) & thereby strikes (a form of dissention), is the press next? So why are world leaders happy about this? Are they assuming a military dictator (no one has been elected yet) is better than Mubarak?

The number of people who vote has nothing to do with the fact that we change our leaders through elections.  Perhaps you could explain how you think we change leaders.

We will now see if Washington's words of support for the pro-democracy demonstrators was just empty talk. If Washington continues to fund the army, then we will know it was.  But the young Egyptians who paid with their blood for this uprising will not be decieved. They will persist until they achieve genuine democracy. And they will choose leaders based on what they percieve to be in their own self-interests. Not Washington's. And not Tel-Aviv's.

The answer:   "Turkey, 1950--since then, NO military has EVER willfully handed power back to the people."  Let's hope to God the Egyptian military keeps its word.

Jemaah Islamiyah appears to be similar to Muslim Brotherhood.  Indonesia cleric on 'terror trial'   "In recent weeks, hardliners also have stepped up attacks on Christians and minority sect members.  Despite no significant terror attacks in Indonesia for nearly two years, security in the capital is pervasive, with checkpoints placed at the entrance of all major shopping malls, hotels, embassies and government buildings.  Shadowy movement  The 72-year-old Bashir, is officially the caretaker of an Islamic boarding school on Java island but has long been considered the spiritual leader of the shadowy Jemaah Islamiyah movement, which seeks to establish a Muslim caliphate across Southeast Asia."   Okay, so to prevent "significant" religious attacks there has to be "checkpoints placed at the entrance of all major shopping malls, hotels, embassies and government buildings.   Egyptian liberals should leave well enough alone.

Those 2 were replaced by military junta. Nothing was met, absolutely nothing.  Emergency law... in effect. Military kangaroo courts... in place. Political prisoners... locked up. Torture ministry... untouched. Int'l obligations (aka looting and abandoning Palestinians)... no change. State tv... in hands of dictators. Opposition... brushed off. People... ignored.  Blood shed for nothing. This is what I call Obama-revolution... from 1 dictator to group of dictators.

Now they need to stop these juveniles who care more about being protesters than what they are protesting.  If these kids are given too much influence the path to democracy will be in   jeopardy.

Perhaps instead of you mother's britches, you should be considering your mother's civics textbooks.  The democratic process works just fine in Canada. The abrogation of voting responsibilities is definitely an issue, but doesn't change the fact that our democratic processes work just fine. Elections are conducted regularly and legally, and produce smooth changes in government.

The number of people who vote has nothing to do with the fact that we change our leaders through elections. Perhaps you could explain how you think we change leaders. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  How did this story become a discussion about Canadian Politics?  But since you brought it up, let me explain:  Wh had two "right wing" parties, neither of which had any chance of winning an election at the time.  They then get together and form a coalition of "right wing" followers.  (we had NO say in that)  Then they decide among them as to who will be their leader (We had NO say in that)  We have a general election where the majority of canadians Did NOT vote for this "right wing" coalition. (we DID have a say in this, but it didn't work)  So, here we are being governed by s person who is supported by large coorporations and seems to have "dictator" style leadership!  Under this, large coorporation sponsered, type of government where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer (which is happening right now) We will soon be in a similar situation where the top minority have all the wealth and the rest of us will not be  much better off than they are!

I posted before about the severe attention-deficit disorder that plagues the entire world and our impatience for immediate results. There is not going to be any immediate results. Transition takes time. If you want to try your luck raising heck against the Army I think you'll find them a much more determined and aggressive ruler than Mubarak ever was. They ain't going anywhere. They are now in charge. No two weeks of camping out in Tahrir Square is going to get them to hop on a plane and take off for the Bahamas. I guess you're going to have to take them at their word. And be patient. Cheers.

If they leave now the power void will be quickly filled by another authoritarian leader/group.   If they want to have any say in how things are to change going forward, they need to force that change themselves.   Think I'm wrong?

It is the same military and same "special" police that are taking over rand will cling to power just as the previous dictators did. After they organize a "new" party of their own they will "win" the elections and stay on. Main objective was to get the crowds under control without to much visible damage and now to prevent them to raise their heads again. Prisons will fill quickly again and any show of discontent will be punished before it gets of the ground. Egypt like all the rest of the middle east countries will stay the way it always was.

A young new generation equipped with internet, facebook and twitter. And they have effectively accomplished their mission. They have overthrown the dictator. They have done it through peaceful demonstrations. They were not pushed away by   Mubaruk supporters thugs or by any fanatic religious ideas. They need to go home now and free the square. They have formed a coalition to protest every Friday and to put a pressure on the military government.  They need to put trust on the military and so far the military had done an outstanding job. The military also in the right direction in  “banning protests and strikes”. The country need to resume to a normal life. Let them amend the constitution and create good atmosphere for new government to be elected in six month.  Then it will be up to the new government to full fill the wishes of its people. If not they will be thrown out in an election.

I may be a bit slow, but isn’t this called a Military Coup?   Correct.  It is a military coup and it's probably the army that will pick the next leader, president, dictator, despot whatever and he will rule like his predecessors: with an iron fist.  The Egyptian parliament was a useless institution, during the crisis, it was so silent that we did not even know that there was an Egyptian parliament.  And this total silence and passivity coming from an Egyptian parliament in 2011 is so unlike the English parliament that adopted the English Bill of Rights on December 16, 1689.  England in 1689, now that was a Revolution when the English parliament limited the powers of the kings and laid out the basis of our freedoms and liberties.    Sure there will be more riots and demonstrations in the Arab world but they will all end like Egypt: the Army will step in and put a lid on it.    Lesson for anarchists: You cannot change the world by marching up and down the streets like the Egyptians have done for the last three weeks.

And you need to get your news outside of CBC. It's well known this was a coup. Not a violent one but the morning after Mubarak gave his speech that he wouldn't hand over power, the most likely scenario was the military wouldn't fire on its own people so they asked Mubarak to leave without any blood loss. Quit griping and give the people and military a chance to resolve their own problems as they've agreed whether you like it or not. Or would you prefer the USA step in and its "cronies" as so many complain about?

If the military promotes democratic reforms, and allows fair elections, it will be one of the few times a military regime has done this.  Not saying it couldn't happen, just saying it would be unusual.  If the military fires on crowds, imprisons protesters, tortures prisoners, to whom do they answer?  Certainly not to a civilian court of law, or a parliament.  The only good news here is that the world is watching, and is firmly on the side of the Egyptian people.

We know that in the hearts and minds of the Egyptian people the vast majority were very much in favour of the regieme change and to new democracy. That is what has been achieved and anyone to claim other wise is a complete and total idiot who does nto even understand life going on around them.   The army has shown very good restraint in not being used as an agent of violence and it is they who actuallly allowed this all to happen. Even though they have now been given the power to run that country, they are holding up the values that the protestors called for and have now set in motion the workings for free and fair elections in 6 months time. This shows us that they are more then willing to be an army within the democracy of the new government. The Eqyptian people should not be afraid to vote. In fact they shopuld be proud to vote and they need to be informed of all the candidates and vote for the ones who will best represent their own values. The 40% of the people who used to live on $2 a day will now be able to get way more and yes the poorest will have a lot more money after this is all settled. The people of the Mubarak regieme will all be thrown out of their high paying civil service jobs and the people who will then work for much less will take on those positions and more workers will then be hired to give jobs with reasonable pay. This will allow many more jobs for the young educated people of this country. That will give them hope. The facts seem to be that much of Egypt was ruled by an eleite class and they suppressed the lower class. These elitists will now be vanquished and their money siezed by the state and it will go a long way to be redistributed to the poor to be a 3 class system.

In Naomi Kleins book The Shock Doctrine, Stephen Kinzer explains this pattern well.    Stage one; a US based multinational corporation is threatened in some way.    Stage two;  US politicians reinterpret this threat as an attack by transforming the situation from an economic one to a political.  They do this by stating the government must be dictatorial, oppressive etc.  Stage three;  US politicians then sell the need for intervention as a struggle between good vs evil, sound familiar?    Now, with the threat of war hanging over their heads do you think the people will strike?   I bet the war mongers have their fingers crossed....

Pew asks whether people distinguish between “innovators” and “fundamentalists” within Islam. Most Egyptians do not. But among those who do distinguish, far more people identify themselves with the fundamentalists than with innovators — 59 percent versus 27. Other aspects of the Egyptian attitudes are also astounding:  82 percent are in favour of punishing adultery with stoning to death. 77 percent believe that thieves and robbers should be punished by flogging or the amputation of a hand.

The peaceful demonstration of the public to enact change in the way government rules it's people. This is nothing more than an attempt to paint a friendly face on that terminology.  This is not the "New World Order" as it was intended. For the truth behind that Google it. It is far more alarming than the main stream media would have you believe. Egypt is not it's birth place or it's poster boy. If anything this would be the old world order. People Power. The New World Order is control over the masses by a very few powerful few. See the difference. Deny the obvious.

The world is on the verge of an epic acceptance of a value set that builds on the core of human rights. A critical part of this value set will be dedicated to energy and the role it plays in prosperity. I believe this value set will be part of a future requirement of Canadian politics starting with the potential of each human being on this planet.  The potential of anyone to contribute to the basic nature of what it means to have access to prosperity, the unyielding access to contribute to their own prosperity. To recognize a resource based economy as the only way forward. To globalize the recognition of humanities potential to overcome our collective weaknesses, by allowing a pathway to prosperity that is universally and undeniably accessible.  There is pathway towards prosperity that leads an accelerative convergence to that which is scientifically sustainable. The global common denominator to the renaissance of our time is energy and how accessibility to energy can provide the prosperity to all humanity unimpeded by sovereignty and the endless variety of governance failures to deliver this promise. Canadians must recognize our collective responsibility to use our capabilities based on our scientific and social successes to converge with common purpose on that which is sustainable. The forces of global governance is waiting and wanting this paradigm, a shift which is gaining traction and it has been a long time coming.   Think of sovereignty as important as it still is, as the last Castle wall denying prosperity for all humanity, the invisible line in the sand dictated by the few.  The Governance of Canada needs to step up. Seriously, step up.

Why?  Simply because both have an urge to dictate and are ready to use force for that.  Those who don't use force go into corporations.  Salesmen and saleswomen too are bullies in their own right.   May be it is politically incorrect to say, but the west has a significant amount of bullies and potential dictators.   Now to fight bullies you can resort to anarchy, which is the anti-thesis of bullying, but no less bully either.  In short, being bully is the norm.  Those who are bullied should simply take the courage and give the bully its change.  To submit means you'll die anyway so you take the bully with you as well and have that animal judged in heaven.  But again this might be too politically incorrect to say.

It should not be forgotten, however, that the military is an oligarchy which controls huge swaths of the Egyptian economy.   SFChronicle: It owns companies that sell everything from fire extinguishers and medical equipment to laptops, televisions, sewing machines, refrigerators, pots and pans, butane gas bottles, bottled water and olive oil. Its holdings include vast tracts of land, including the Sharm el-Sheikh resort, where ex-President Hosni Mubarak now resides in one of his seaside palaces. Bread from its bakeries has helped head off food riots. Time notes: Another source of the military's untold wealth is its hold on one of this densely populated country's most precious commodities: public land, which is increasingly being converted into gated communities and resorts. The military has other advantages: it does not pay taxes and does not have to deal with the bureaucratic red tape that strangles the private sector.  ...The revenue streams from its various holdings help the military maintain the lifestyle its officers have grown accustomed to, including an extensive network of luxurious social clubs as well as comfortable retirements — all of which helps ensure officer loyalty. Not surprisingly, the military has opposed privatization and economic liberalization. The Egyptian military currently commands a great deal of respect in Egypt but what happens when a nascent democracy tries to reform an entrenched oligarchy?" http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2011/02/the-pharaoh-and-the-comannding-heights.html#comments

Just because Mubarek claims he has relinquished power, and is physically absent from government buildings, doesn't mean he's not still mostly in control of the country. He has money, and he has powerful friends - some of which probably owe him a favour or two.  If I were an Egyptian I'd want some assurances. I'd want Mubarek in custody, monitored 24/7 by a civilian group. He should not have access to communicate with any of his cohorts.

If the citizens can feel reassured that they are in good hands now, they will probably hold off, so something symbolic and powerful is needed.  But so far the military has done nothing of the sort and so people are still worried.

Mubarak's Parliament and his constitution were necessary casualties - the military is seen by Egyptians as having legitimacy.  That somehow these actions by the military are a precurser to another military dictatorship seems totally premature.  I think the military recognizes that Egypt passed an important democratic milestone with the removal of Mubarak.   Ask any Egyptian - even the superwealthy Mr. Mubarak.

If a radical Islamic regime is elected in Egypt... We agree that is their decision. If this spreads throughout the Middle East, we will have to resign ourselves to another kind of Iron or Bamboo curtain separation... for at least the next 60 years.

Those who have been in control are unlikely to just roll over and die. There is far more at stake here than just the desire of a single nation. The global elite cannot afford to have the people dictate policy. Over the past few days the focus has been on Egypt for a specific reason. What has happened in the street here is not taken lightly.

That is what Egyptian democracy will look like.   A democratic majority of the country supports murdering people in the name of Islam.   Mubarak's government does not execute apostates or adulterers.   But a democratic Egypt will.   Why?   Because it's the will of the people.

Unless you want to go out and murder all coptic Eqyptians for the sake of being coptic, keep women as dumb as the rocks you would throw at them, and live life in worse squalor than you do now.  2.500 years ago the greeks re-innvented a type of government (democracy)not seen since the earliest tribal days of man, when everyone in a tribe had a say as to what was going on. Everything else is just another form of tyrrany.  Democracies are not for the ignorant or illiterate, it is advanced citizenship, where everyone is required to be tolerant of the person next to them, and stick up for the rights of others to speak of their beliefs even if you don't agree with them.

Be careful what you wish for because you just might get it.  He he he.  Egypt, you aren't ready for democracy quite yet.  The middle east is not ready for democracy - Iraq/Afghanistan proves this.

Then, it can go back to ruling.  Odds of this happening.....near zero.  The low probability is what makes keeping the pressure on them so important because the Egypt military will have no credibility whatsoever until it asks to freeze those Mubarak assets & accounts.

"We are tired of paying big wages to managers"  You think there is a message there? Do you think this hits close to our complaints about corporate greed, politicians and bureaucrats earning large wages with little reaching the common person?  Look at the truly sad state here, and I am not going to exaggerate, public programs with little impact on the general population (ie. Food Safety), Colleges that do not govern members properly (ie. Physicians and Surgeons), crumbling infrastructure with huge tax revenues going into support it (ie. Poor state of our roads), and I haven't even touched on the horrible state of the First Nations, kids going to school hungry, child poverty, or mass aid money not being used appropriately.  This mans words are very prophetic and they echo true here, we just haven't had the right spark yet.

It's not going to happen overnight, there will be many differences of opinion and depending on those differences there could be blood shed.  Ousting Mubarak was the smallest and easiest step on this road to Capitaliz... er, um, I mean democracy.  Instead of having one man to hate you'll end up with hundreds of faceless corporations to hate, making it virtually impossible to organize and protest against.  Oh well, enjoy the sweet taste of victory, it's about to be replaced with bile.

Those securities plummeted in value as foreign speculators (EG: GS) shunned them.  Today, credit default swap spreads on Egyptian debt have substantially dropped in value, as international speculators are betting on further upheaval, targeting Egypt like just another number on a dartboard. Mubarak knew about all this, he is a puppet of the USA & indirectly THE BILDERBERG. The USA has 'owned' the Egyptian Army for 30 years.

And you need to get your news outside of CBC. It's well known this was a coup. __________________  You left out the rest of my coup indicating this was a soft coup. And I agree with you 100% but Mubarak didn't step down on his own with this one. It may have been a slight nudge by military but it was a nudge none the lest to take over. Even if its replacing the same with the same until the egyptian people can vote in who they want. Again, as the quote was cut off, lets just wait until September before we make too many judgements. Personally I think its 50/50 between going to someone they truly elect or all to hell with the Muslim Brotherhood. I don't trust any of the good face the MB has put on. Eitherway the people got what they wanted, for now.

Pity they're are only good at fighting their own people rather than fighting other armies.

They rule with an Iron Clad Fist they got as a “gift” from England, USA and other interests... sad really.. they at least tried.

The protesters wanted Mubarak out of office, and they got it.  They wanted parliament dissolved and the constitution suspended, and they got it.  They wanted someone else to take over until elections can be held, and they got it.  Many of the protesters' largest demands were met, and nobody can re-write a constitution and hold a federal election overnight.  Now it's time for the protesters to step down.

TEHRAN, Iran –  Dozens of Iranian opposition supporters were reportedly arrested on Monday after participating in a banned rally in Tehran to support popular uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia, according to an Iranian opposition website.  "Witnesses say in some parts of Tehran security forces arrested dozens of protesters," opposition leader Mirhossein Mousavi's Kaleme website reported.  Security forces fired tear gas to scatter thousands of opposition supporters marching toward a Tehran square, a witness told Reuters. There were also clashes between police and demonstrators, resulting in dozens of arrests, in Isfahan in central Iran, the country's third largest city
