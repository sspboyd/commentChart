# Comparing recommendations on News Articles

This is the code from a brief test that charted the number of "thumbs up" different articles received on a series of different CBC News articles back in 2011. 

The initial code was written in Processing 3.X or maybe even 2.X back then, I'm not sure. The code's since been updated in 2019 to run on Processing v3.5.3.
